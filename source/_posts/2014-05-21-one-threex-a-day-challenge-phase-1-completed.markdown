Hello everybody!

It's been nearly a month since I started the ["One threex a day" challenge](/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/). The idea was to share with you the many [three.js games extensions](http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/) that I had written over time. I wanted to show you how they could be useful, fun and easy to include in your very own three.js game. I came up with a motto "One threex a day gets your game on its way". I was all set up and ready to go. This was a challenge inspired by John Resig's article called ["Write code everyday"](http://ejohn.org/blo!/write-code-every-day/). I deeply agree with his theory for making progress, increasing productivity and getting the work done. I wished to try something similar on myself. 

I've had an interesting experience and I'm pleased with the result. Obviously, some posts got more attention than others. I think this was because the three.js game extensions I published weren't all for hard-core developers or game creators. Some were pretty basic, but still had educational value for people just starting with three.js. I wanted them to be directed to all kinds of audience, amateurs and experts alike. I really appreciated the process of sharing these extensions, and overall I had a great response. I got some very cool retweets and a lot of positive echo from you guys. Thanks a lot! Don't hesitate to contact me and give me some more feedback. 

Let me tell you though... it WAS challenging! Keeping the publication rhythm was hard. It takes a lot of discipline and organization to get it done everyday. I had the intention of doing it for a period of two months but I think it will be best to rest for a while. Last friday i published the last three.js game extension of phase 1.

But wait, I'm not saying I'm giving up. Far from it. I have promised myself, and I promise my readers, to come back with more three.js extensions. Specially, because I still have a lot to publish, there are still some tricks up my sleeve ;)  For the moment I will concentrate on regaining my strength, writing more code and documenting it for the next threex batch. I hope to deliver and publish it soon.

Stay tuned! I'll be back.
