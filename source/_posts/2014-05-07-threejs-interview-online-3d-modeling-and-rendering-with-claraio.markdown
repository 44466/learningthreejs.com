Hello everybody! This is my first *Three.js Interview* video. The inspiration came from all those great people out there doing [very cool projects with three.js](http://threejs.org). I want to share their innovations with others. If you know me, you know that I love talking about three.js. So, I would like everybody to have the opportunity to enjoy and learn from these [three.js interviews](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/categories/threejsInterview/). Maybe you could get some ideas for your own project or simply partake on a subject you're passionate about. 

The idea is to have interesting people come and talk about cool things that they've done with three.js. Like [Ben Houston](https://twitter.com/BenAtExocortex), who is our guest in this first video. Ben is the Team Leader for [Clara.io](http://clara.io/), a online 3D modeling and rendering tool that you can use inside you browser. Ben talks to us about the creation and the evolution of [Clara.io](http://clara.io/) and about all the interesting features it's got!

I hope you enjoy it and stay tuned for the next Three.js Online Meeting :)
