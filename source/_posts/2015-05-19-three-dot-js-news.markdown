# What's New in Three.js?  

* Hello everybody 
* Welcome to Three.js News!
* Today we are gonna take a look at some great demos I have seen. 
* They are very diverse. Some are portfolios, other are games, some even use street view. 
* What they have in common is that they are all very creative, and they all use 3d. 

## Jon Daly's Portfolio

* This first demo is actually the portfolio of [Jon Daly](http://jondaly.io/) 
* You can see some fuzzy filaments dancing around as if attracted by the letters in the center. 
* The whole thing is very impressive even if it's marked as a work in progress.  

## Exploding Websites

* Jon Daly has been busy. Here is another cool [demo](http://explode.website/) created by him.
* There is something extremely fun about destroying webpages! 
* You choose the website you want and Boom! 
* Is as if you dropped a bomb inside a building and you watched it come down in pieces
* There are some great physics in this demo and the idea is just pure fun! 

## SpaceLamb

* Yeah that's right! A [game](http://spacelamb.12wave.com/) about lambs in space. 
* This interactive and very fun game was created by  [12wave](http://www.12wave.com/)
* It has great visuals and I'm sure you will love it.
* C'mon guys, you are actually a lamb flying in outer space surfing through asteroids! 

## Brick Street View 
![screen shot 2015-05-18 at 17 22 05](/data/2015-05-19-three-dot-js-news/screenshots/Brick Street View.png)

* [Brick Street View](http://brickstreetview.com/streetview/AcC_uoVfL76IHeVNVU64BA) is the mind-blowing demo created by [Einar Oberg](http://www.inear.se/)
* This demo shows us a lego block version of Google Maps. 
* He did another one of the same kind using [Urban Jungle] (http://inear.se/urbanjungle/) instead of Lego.
* Search any address you want, hover over cities and zoom in for a 360 view. 
* The world around  is built in Lego form. It is an awesome idea! Let's get cubed ;) 

## WebGL Interactive Style

* [DB5 Interactive](http://www.simonreeves.com/projects/db5/) is a nicely done demo by [Simon Reeves] (http://www.simonreeves.com/) using three.js 
* For all car lovers out there you are gonna love this one. 
* You can check out a vintage automobile and interact with it in real-time. Classy style! 
* Very good use of shaders to create glossy and shiny effects.

## Follow The Rainbow 

![screen shot 2015-05-18 at 17 22 05](/data/2015-05-19-three-dot-js-news/screenshots/RainbowRoad.png)

* [Rainbowroad](http://rainbowroad.jp/special03/) is an imaginative and colourful Japanese creation. 
* You advance in the rainbow path destroying musical notes along the way. 
* All this while enjoying songs from artist [Ayaka](http://room-ayaka.jp/rainbowroad/) 
* You can move around smoothly. It is lots of fun!
