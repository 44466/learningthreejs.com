Hello everybody

Welcome to a new edition of Three.js News. In this episode we have gathered some of the most impressive demos of the past weeks. We will play with fun webgl games, matrix-like maps and visit beautiful landscapes. We will also discover apocalyptic experiences, large terrains and original animations.  

### Vortex Spheres

[Vortex Spheres](http://david.li/vortexspheres/) is a swirly webgl demo by [David Li](https://twitter.com/daviddotli). It is a wild vertically growing mass of green and blueish spheres. You can tune variation, radius or just let it drop. 

### LOD terrain

[LOD terrain](http://felixpalmer.github.io/lod-terrain/) is a great example of how to efficiently render a large terrain in 3D. You can check out [Felix Palmer's](https://twitter.com/pheeelicks) detailed [tutorial](http://www.pheelicks.com/2014/03/rendering-large-terrains/) on how to build it using webgl and three.js. 

### Spring

Beautiful webgl [spring](http://oos.moxiecode.com/js_webgl/spring/). Great light sets the natural mood on the landscape. You will feel like walking barefoot on the grass. Created by [OutofSociety moxiecode](https://twitter.com/oosmoxiecode). 

### Reshaping Excellence

This project is Sennheiser's own [webgl experience](http://www.sennheiser-reshapingexcellence.com/en). It takes us to an apocalyptic and inspiring world. Descending monoliths carry us to a monument of sound. Done by [Sehsucht](https://twitter.com/SEHSUCHT), there is also a mobile version that you can try out. 

### Mapzen

This matrix-like [demo](http://tangrams.github.io/tangram-sandbox/tangram.html?styles/tilt-ikeda#17/53.33463/-6.22539) is developed by [Mapzen](https://twitter.com/mapzen), an open source mapping lab. Tangram is a flexible mapping engine, designed for real-time rendering. It is a new wireframe way to look at your city with a wow effect. 

### Keep Out 
![keep_out](/data/2015-09-24-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-15-creative-3d-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/keep_out.jpg)

[Keep Out](http://www.playkeepout.com/) is a fun dungeon game for the brave. It was created by [Little Workshop](http://www.littleworkshop.fr/), company crafting fine experiences and games for webgl. There is a lot of action, monsters to kill, gold to loot, weapons to win and levels to clear! 

### Cycle Through The Night

This original Codepen [demo](http://codepen.io/SaschaSigl/pen/dYMYKg) was developed by [Sascha Sigl](https://twitter.com/SaschaSigl). It's a skeletal animation made in three.js. A modern dandy riding a high wheel bicycle towards a full grey moon gives it an intelligently comic atmosphere. 

### Conclusion
Ok guys, that's all for this edition. There were some awesome demos these weeks and featuring them all in a post is a challenge. The ones we listed here are our personal favorites. We will be back soon with more Three.js News...stay tuned.
