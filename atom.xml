    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>This post is about edition 14 of Three.js News. Our favorite demos of last week were very fun to play around with. There were some set above the clouds, staring directly at the sun. Some were cool webgl experiences inspired by games and movies. Some showed a brilliant use of shaders and VR technology. And we even met a three.js sock puppet!</p>

<h3>Evolution</h3>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is to announce Three.js office hours. A practical and easy way to get answers to your questions.
The principle is simple: you post your questions on twitter with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23learningthreejs">#learningthreejs</a>
hashtag and we will try to answer them.</p>

<p>It is a direct channel for the three.js community.  We told ourselves that since our blog is about learning three.js, our mission is to coach and guide willing learners. We are starting it as an experiment, we will try it out and see how it goes. We noticed that people out there have many queries. Whether you are working with it as part of a project, or experimenting with it as a hobby, three.js can be tricky. We have been receiving emails and notifications with kind words (thank you for that!)&#8230; and a lot of questions too :) You expect answers and we want to deliver them.</p>

<p>So the idea behind Three.js office hours is to help you get around your troublesome issues. If you are stuck and don&#8217;t understand something we encourage you to post your questions in the Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23learningthreejs">#learningthreejs</a>. If you have sent us queries before and we have overlooked them (sorry for that), please don&#8217;t hesitate to ask about it on the hashtag.</p>

<p>We will then pick up questions that you guys posted and record a short video. We will answer them one by one, giving you detailed advice and useful pointers. In addition to that, we will write a blogpost about the content of the video, and publish it so you can come back to it whenever you want.</p>

<p>Thanks for participating in this experience with us. We are sure your questions will benefit the whole three.js community, so don&#8217;t be shy!</p>

<p>There is always something new to learn ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody</p>

<p>Welcome to a new episode of Three.js News. This time we will discover some artistic and abstract demos. We will go through them at fast speed, see them grow, expand and dissolve. We will also get a bit spooked by a creepy head!</p>

<h3>Bjork&#8217;s website</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/bjork.jpg" alt="bjork" /></p>

<p>Beause arty design is also a three.js matter, here is a beautiful <a href="http://bjork.com/">demo</a> created by Vince Mckelvie from <a href="https://twitter.com/mmparisdotcom">M/M</a> design agency in Paris. It&#8217;s singer Bjork&#8217;s new website.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://haxiomic.github.io/GPU-Fluid-Experiments/html5/?q=UltraHigh">demo</a> is an experiment with Fluid particles in Webgl. It was developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/Haxiomic">George Corney</a> and it has great effects. It is both hypnotic and mesmerising.</p>

<h3>Meander</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/meander.jpg" alt="meander" /></p>

<p><a href="http://codedoodl.es/_/inconvergent/meander">Meander</a> consists of randomly generated organic sand-storm clouds that dance around the screen. Its author, <a href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent">Anders Hoff</a> shared this via <a href="http://codedoodl.es/">Codedoodl</a> a tool to create original code sketches.</p>

<h3>Arrows</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/arrows.jpg" alt="arrows" /></p>

<p>Like a painting in a canvas, this <a href="http://codedoodl.es/_/cabbibo/arrows">demo</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Cabbibo">Cabbibo</a> is abstract and bursting with colour. The arrows wander around like small brush strokes in 3D. You can also find it at <a href="http://codedoodl.es/">Codedoodl</a>.</p>

<h3>Signal barrel</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/signal_barrel.jpg" alt="signal_barrel" /></p>

<p><a href="http://codepen.io/austinmayer/full/oXRGez/">Signal barrel</a> is a demo created by <a href="https://twitter.com/amayer_">Austin Mayer</a> and inspired by a similar project by <a href="https://twitter.com/beeple">Beeple</a>. It is a very cool tunnel like recreation on <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>. You will want to follow it &#8216;til the end.</p>

<h3>Fungal State</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/fungal_state.jpg" alt="fungal_state" /></p>

<p>This evolutive <a href="http://gregtatum.com/poems/growth/#/2-fungus">demo</a> was created by the talented <a href="https://twitter.com/TatumCreative">Greg Tatum</a>. It shows us a dynamic and realtime growing fungus shape. It is part of Greg&#8217;s <a href="http://gregtatum.com/blog/">Growth series</a>.</p>

<h3>Creepy Head</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/creepy_head.jpg" alt="creepy_head" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://codepen.io/SaschaSigl/full/MwMOag/">demo</a> is a creepy morph animation made with javascript. It was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/SaschaSigl">Sascha Sigl</a> on <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>. The way the mouth moves and the eyes follow you is kind of disturbing and spooky :)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Okay guys, that&#8217;s all the news for this week. We discovered some very artistic, abstract and fast paced projects. Some evolving and expanding, morphing and growing&#8230;and some freaking us out! In any case, they are all creative and fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is another edition of Three.js News. We have collected some original demos with skilful effects and lots of style. There is a high degree of talent displayed on these projects. In this episode, we will cycle through the daring climbs of the Tour de France. We will turn around decadent blue worlds, play with colourful Rubik&#8217;s cube and take the new Renault Espace for a test run. We will also merge and morph with creative experiences and investigate fascinating generative compositions.</p>

<h3>Metropolis</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/metropolis.jpg" alt="metropolis" /></p>

<p><a href="https://alexstockdale.com/metropolis/">Metropolis</a> is an impressive demo by <a href="https://twitter.com/ALIXPLOX">Alex Stockdale</a>. It is a spheric vision of an urban world in destruction, or construction, depending on how you see it. It has a decadent aspect to it, the light is like the shadow of a dream and there is a hazy bluish shade in the atmosphere. This project is not only interactive and skilful but it is also a great example of what we can do with three.js.</p>

<p><a href="http://playcanv.as/p/V9B7k46n">Roobix</a> is a very fun game created by <a href="https://twitter.com/marquizzo">Marco del Valle</a> on <a href="https://playcanvas.com/">Play Canvas</a>. It is a Rubik&#8217;s cube simulator with great animations. The rotations and puzzle combinations are extremely fun to play with. The cube is very reactive and the twinkling colours are part of the features that make this game unique.</p>

<h3>Renault Espace</h3>

<p><a href="http://ommexperience.com/">Omm Experience</a> shows us the fantastic world created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jhelf">Jean Helfenstein</a>. At first, there is an awesome lens flare effect with a halo of light glowing around a revolving asteroid. As the demo evolves, there are 3 chapters about creativity with great morphing and merging animations that transform and deform the object as if it was a ball of water.</p>

<h3>Gridiron</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/gridiron.jpg" alt="gridiron" /></p>

<p><a href="http://haptic-data.com/project/gridiron">Gridiron</a> is &#8220;an exploration of generative compositions based on vertical structures fighting for space&#8221; developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hapticdata">Kyle Phillips</a>. We can see procedurally generated geometries that rain up and fill the screen. We can also modify their properties and play with the effects. It kind of reminds me of chemistry class.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this edition of Three.js News we saw the talent behind daring and challenging experiences like the Tour de France, behind life-like animations and reactive games like Rubik&#8217;s cube. We floated through procedurally generated worlds and through spheric decadent visions of a city. We took a drive around our imagination and witnessed creativity in its abstract form.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing. Stay tuned for more Three.js News and see you next time.</p>

    <id>http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2015/07/30/three-dot-js-inspector-in-chrome-devtools</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>Recently people started to experiment with three.js and Chrome devtools. The excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/thespite">@thespite</a> first did <a href="https://github.com/spite/ShaderEditorExtension">Shader Editor Extension</a> and then <a href="https://twitter.com/thespite/status/624256879766712320">Three.js Editor Extension</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdoob">@mrdoob</a> did it too <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdoob/status/616042217464012800">here</a> where he links directly to the <a href="http://threejs.org/editor">three.js editor</a> itself. The goal is to make an extension which allows to inspect your page when you are debugging three.js.</p>

<p>All that is very early work, but the concept seems really promising. It will allow to interact with almost all three.js demos out there. It is a great tool to debug your own work, or to understand how a demo is done. You can even use it to fine tune your parameters.</p>

<p>I loved it so I decided to give it a shot. I forked @thespite work and looked at it over the last weekend. I reused the UI layer from the three.js editor, improved the UI a bit, and applied it to the Chrome Dev tools. The implementation still clearly has some quirks, but I love the concept. I believe it can be a very strong tool to debug three.js.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threejs-inspector/dnhjfclbfhcbcdfpjaeacomhbdfjbebi">Three.js Inspector Extension</a> on chrome app store and play with it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about the 10th episode of Three.js News. We are very happy to share exceptional demos with you every week. In all the 3D experiences we have shared on previous episodes, we have witnessed talent, dedication and skill. Without so many creative projects we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to continue with the news. So, to celebrate this 10th edition, we are going to travel through space, time and even dimensions.</p>

<p>In this episode, we will explore other worlds and make musical journeys across decades and light years. We will wonder around the Parisian metro in a different light and be amazed by the simple beauty of land and stone. We will interact with the futuristic and be repelled by the terrestrial. We will learn to safeguard and preserve our cultural heritage through online 3D, and finally, take a walk through the magical woods of the imagination.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This demo shows Hatsune Miku dancing in augmented reality within
your browser! This is great and surprisingly easy to do.
All that running on your browser, based on web standards.
I did it to show it was possible to do AR within the browser. I wanted to share the code to see what you guys can do with it.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-07-16-hatsune-miku-dancing-in-augmented-reality/screenshots/screenshot-nexus9.png" width="350"></p>

<p>Best of all, it even runs on mobile phones that
support WebGL and WebRTC.
The screenshot on the right is made on a nexus.
So we can do augmented reality within the browser on mobile</p>

<blockquote><p>We can do augmented reality within the browser on currently deployed mobile phones today!
There is nothing to wait for.</p></blockquote>

<script src="https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"></script>


<h2>How is it coded ?</h2>

<p>It is mainly a link of 2 parts.
First <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.webar">webar extensions</a>
for three.js. They bundle what is needed to handle augmented reality with three.js, from the webcam setup to the marker localisation.
Second part is the <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_loader_mmd">mmd loader</a> which loads the model. It loads the Hatsune Miku model and its animations.</p>

<p>Once you got those 2 parts, things are simple :) you just have to display your model where your marker is.
To know the tech details, you will have to dig in <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_loader_mmd">the</a>
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.webar">code</a>.
I will likely talk more about AR tho.</p>

<h2>Now Let&#8217;s Do a Bit of History</h2>

<p>I did this to show it was possible to do AR within the browser and to share the code to see what you guys can do with it.
It was for a <a href="http://daqri.com/dublinhacks/">AR oriented hackathon</a> in Dublin.
It recently landed a <a href="https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/572435641079877632">new job</a> at <a href="http://daqri.com">Daqri</a>. Part of my job is developer relations, so I get to help people doing AR. I love it :)</p>

<p>All the code to handle Hatsune Miku is from
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/takahiro-aoyagi/96/10a/41a">Takahiro Aoyagi</a>.
He did a <a href="http://github.io/takahirox/three.js">fork on three.js</a> to load mmd formats, the format used to store Hatsune Miku.
It may be included in three.js soon.
Here is his <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_loader_mmd">example for three.js</a>
It all started with his <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/mmd-viewer-js/">mmd viewer</a> in pure webgl.
The original contains a LOT of neat features like inverse kinetic, physics for the hair,
a toon shader to make the color more cartoonish, a edge shader to enhance the outline of the model
like a drawing.
He is doing excellent work. Check him out on twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/superhoge">@superhoge</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s have a word about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku">Hatsune Miku</a> herself.
It is such a nice story.
She is a Japanese star but she is purely virtual.
She is a humanoid persona which appears as a drawing or as a hologram.
There is no human behind, even for the voice!
When she sings, what you hear is a voice synthesizer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypton_Future_Media">crypton</a>
All that is crazy but true :)</p>

<p>She even does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEaBqiLeCu0">concerts</a> where thousand of fans are go to see her.
Actual human fans I mean, not virtual ones.
As you can see, Hatsune Miku is no stranger to augmented reality.
I love her!</p>

<h2>How To Run The Demo ?</h2>

<p>You may want to run this demo obviously.
Here is how to do it.
First you put the <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/demo.hatsunemiku-augmentedreality">demo url</a> in your browser.
It will read your webcam using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia">getUserMedia</a>. When it asks for permission, allow it :)
Then you need to put this <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/demo.hatsunemiku-augmentedreality/marker/image-marker-265.html">AR marker</a> in front of the camera.
You can print it and point the camera toward the paper
or you can load the marker web page and put the phone in front of the camera.
And now you can see Hatsune Mike Dancing in Augmented Reality.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s look at it in action in this little screencast.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://learningthreejs.com//www.youtube.com/embed/ObVR2mOM-3Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you want to experiment with augmented reality and three.js, checkout <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.webar">threex.webar</a>.
It is so cool to make augmented reality on the web!
I hope you have as much fun as I had doing it :)
I can&#8217;t wait to see what augmented reality will do on mobile&#8217;s browsers.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all folks. Have fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is another post for Three.js News. In this eighth edition we are going to travel and dance with cubes, discover Swiss ground with points, and do some commuting with lines. We have a couple of educational viewers, one for asteroids and another, less space related but equally exact, for terrains. We will enjoy turning around with funky vertex and spinning helix. We will discover some beautiful models skillfully displayed in Three.js. We will also be able to measure and forecast happiness.</p>

We saw paranoid birds in another three.js news. Now its time for the king of the jungle. You will see a very cute animation of a lion who is in desperate need of chillin&#8217; and refreshment. It must be a very warm summer day for him. By clicking you activate the ventilation and  when turning around with your mouse you make wind blow in every direction. The lion will definitely appreciate. He will actually smile.</p>

<h3>Holy Running Cow</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/holy_running_cow.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 40 36" /></p>

<p>We just love Yakudoo&#8217;s demos. This one is called <a href="http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/BNNGBq">Mighty Fish</a>. In it you will see a very determined fish, swimming with or against the current. Kind of Nemo&#8217;s father when he couldn&#8217;t find Nemo. You can move your mouse to change speed and direction and see how adorably funny it is.</p>

<h3>Many Icons Using Three.js</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/many_icons_using_threejs.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 42 27" /></p>

<p>Funky <a href="http://codepen.io/clockmaker/details/gpozrX/">demo</a> created by Yasunobu Ikeda in <a href="http://codepen.io/clockmaker/">codepen.io</a>. It shows various icons and letters that come together and turn into one, flowing in a replaying cycle. It changes color every time and it sometimes gives you the impression of being inside the Matrix. This demo was created using the Time Remap effect with Three.js and TweenMax. You can visit the Clock Maker <a href="http://clockmaker.jp/labs/">website</a> to see all Yasunobu&#8217;s experiences in this interactive motion lab.</p>

<p>This one is a captivating <a href="http://freelance-html-developer.com/clock/">demo</a> and a Chrome Experiment developed by <a href="http://freelance-html-developer.com/">Tomasz Slawnikowski</a>, a freelance html developer. It measures time in an original frame. Every second is drawn according to the hour passing by. If you look a it for a while you will feel in a state of unreality, in a haze, hypnotic state. Even if it appears unstable, the clock is ticking!</p>

<h3>Crazy Skills</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/crazy_skills.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 43 42" /></p>

<p>Very kaleidoscopic <a href="http://chrisirhc.github.io/_experiment-sand-webgl/push-field.html">experiment</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisirhc">Chris Chua</a>. In this demo Chris plays around with shaders in WebGL to simulate force over an area. You can click and drag your mouse around to see how a trail is designed, go faster or slower. It almost resembles a small fish in the water.</p>

<h3>I&#8217;ll be back</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/ill_be_back.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 45 27" /></p>

<p>Special mention to this great experience that we found. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBJEP4lsRFY&amp;feature=youtu.be">Le Petit Chef</a> is a masterpiece created by the guys at <a href="http://www.skullmapping.com/">Skull Mapping</a>, <a href="http://www.filipsterckx.be/">Filip Sterckx</a> and <a href="http://www.antoon.be/">Antoon Verbeek</a>. They experimented with projection on a dinner table. Combining 3d animation and motion capture, a miniature chef turns your dish into a grill and cooks right in front of your astonished eyes. I wish I could book a place at this table! It is an awesome experience that I&#8217;m sure you will love.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this episode of Three.js News we have seen awesome projects. All very vivid and lifelike. Some movie related and some really scary, others more realistic and down to protecting earth. They all have their own universe. We experienced physics and particles, projection and motion capture. Regardless of how or by whom they were developed, all these experiences show us what is possible to create in the amazing universe of 3D.</p>

<h3>Paranoid vs. Shy Birds</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/paranoid_vs_shy_birds.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p>This is a very fun <a href="http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/LVyJXw">demo</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/yakudoo">Yakudoo</a> on CodePen. The bird characters are so cute. The one in the middle is the paranoid one. You can move his head around and see how he interacts with the small shy birds. The HTML, CSS and Javascript are visible on the scene.</p>

<h3>Threepark</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/threepark.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p><a href="http://threepark.net/English">Threepark</a> is a cool editor developed by <a href="https://github.com/liguocn">liguocn</a>. Easy to understand and to use, great for artists and 3d lovers. You can create different models and designs. You even have a library of templates to use. Subdivide a model as many times as you like in the <a href="http://threepark.net/English/cagemodeling">cagemodeling</a> canvas. You can also store your models in the cloud and export them into 3d printing format. Great way to unleash your creativity.</p>

<h3>Parrot Hunt</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/parrot_hunt.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p>Very funky retro <a href="http://parrothunt.nergal.se:8080/">game</a>, and also a Chrome Experiment, created by  Magnus Persson aka <a href="https://twitter.com/lallassu">nergal</a> . The idea is to shoot only the parrots, not the flamingos. You can move around and reload your rifle to keep shooting at your prey. Fortunately its not real hunting! You can get really serious and try to improve your score every time like I did! It&#8217;s really enjoyable and it makes you feel like a great aim.</p>

<h3>Ntype</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/ntype.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p><a href="http://ntype.blue/#speed=0.015707963267948967&amp;rotationPlanes=xw,xz,yw,yz,zw&amp;fpr=100&amp;string=NTYPE&amp;drawForms=true&amp;drawTrails=false">Ntype</a> is another Chrome Experiment demo developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinzweerink">Kevin Zweerink</a>. It shows us a compelling and interesting way to explore 4D. The typography is extruded into the 4d dimension. You can change the parameters and settings and customise the rotation planes. You can even modify the trails that the letters leave behind them. There are also a lot of other designs to explore in Kevin&#8217;s <a href="http://kevinzweerink.com/">homepage</a></p>

<h3>WikiGalaxy</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/wiki_galaxy.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.polyfra.me/#">WikiGalaxy</a> is a beautiful and original demo created by <a href="https://twitter.com/WikiGalaxy">Owen Cornec</a>. This experiment takes us to a fantastic space that we actually already use everyday life. We can visualise Wikipedia as a galactic web of information. It&#8217;s a marvellous world of knowledge. There is a map where you can fly over the planets, zoom and search. Wikipedia articles are stars, interests are nebulas. Have a good time learning! You can see more WebGL visualisations  in Owen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.polyfra.me/">portfolio</a></p>

<h3>Multivers3D</h3>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/multivers3d.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p>This is the first <a href="https://multivers3d.fr/#/51184/Home.html">video game demo</a> released by the <a href="https://twitter.com/INF1N1T">multivers3d</a> team. It supports multi-users, cross platforms and it has zero install. This first episode is called Earth Creed. You are a honey bee and you need to harvest pollen and nectar from your environment. You have to use your judgement to equilibrate the balance of the ecosystem. This game will definitely make you love nature.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this post, we discovered some varied and original demos. We traveled through a space of information and explored 4D dimensions. We also played very funky games and designed 3D models with various subdivisions. The experience each of these demos give us is unique. Keep creating such wonderful projects.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Three.js News. See you next time.</p>

<p><a href="http://projects.delimited.io/subunit/demos/spiral-circle-v2.html">Spiral Circle</a> is another cool demo created by Steve Hall. It is based on <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">mbostockâ€™s</a> <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2472e84f78fd03df443f">example</a>. It is extremely hypnotic and it has kind of a disturbing texture, like the skin of a snake monster or something. You can pan to the left to divide the circle in two. Be careful, it&#8217;s alive!</p>

<h2>Hatsune Miku</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku">Hatsune Miku</a> is a Three.js example <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_loader_mmd.html">demo</a> done by <a href="https://twitter.com/superhoge">takahiro</a>. It&#8217;s a very fun demo even if takahiro is still working on improving it. This very cute blue hair girl is Japan&#8217;s sweetheart. She dances in holograms and does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSyWtESoeOc">live concerts</a>&#8230;yeah i&#8217;m not kidding! We are even trying to bring her to life in <a href="https://twitter.com/LearningThreejs/status/600740523574439937">AR</a>.</p>

<h2>Race Against Oblivion</h2>

<p>Race against oblivion or <a href="http://www.timeshift165.com/game">Timeshift</a> is an  original game made by <a href="http://www.ultranoir.com/en/#!/home/">Utranoir</a>. Inspired on the story of a unique French car : The Delahaye 165, you have to race against time to save this one of a kind automobile. The presentation of the game is outstanding, it has great design, background and effects. Bonus, it can be played on both desktop and mobile!</p>

<h2>A Particle Dream</h2>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/a_particle_dream.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 03 05" />
A Particle dream is a <a href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/particle-dream">demo</a> created by <a href="http://www.iamnop.com/">Nop Jiarathanakul</a>. It is one of the latest Chrome experiments. It is a wonderful simulation of particles moving smoothly around. You can choose the shape you want the particles to morph into. The music and the ambiance mix together for a very relaxing result. Oh and you can actually use <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> in this demo.</p>

<h2>Our Galactic Neighbourhood</h2>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/our_galactic_neighborhood.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 02 06" /></p>

<p><a href="http://charliehoey.com/threejs-demos/our-galactic-neighborhood.html">Our Galactic Neighbourhood</a>
is another very educational demo. Developed by creative coder <a href="http://charliehoey.com/">Charlie Hoey</a> this demo is a simulation of the charted stars in our Galaxy. You are able to explore the stars travelling both in space and time. Have you ever wondered how the stars are like lightyears away from Earth? Or how will they be thousands of years from now? This demo is your interstellar adventure.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blogpost we reviewed some 3D demos for Three.js News. They are all very diverse. We saw games, educational projects, simulations and funky characters. What they all have in common is their creativity and the use of 3D technology on the web. Some even go further and incorporate fun control sensor like the Leap Motion device. Have fun checking out all these demos. I hope you enjoy them as much as we did.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Three.js News and see you next time.</p>

    <id>http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2015/05/10/see-through-effect-for-augmented-reality-on-your-phone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post shows how to read your phone camera and make it appears as
transparent, aka to act as a see-through.
It may seems unrelated to 3d at first but
it is extremely useful in augmented reality.
I know it may seem silly :)
But this see-throught is the base of Augmented Reality in a phone.
This and other AR tech will be the subject of future posts.</p>

<p>It makes your device &#8216;appears as transparent&#8217;
So when the user is looking at her device, she is seeing the reality.
You just have to display your augmented part on top
and you got augmented reality. A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words :)</p>

<h2>How It Is Coded</h2>

<p>Webcams are great for interactivity.
  We will read the webcam thanks to <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>,
  html5 API which can be used to do video/audio conferences like  Skype or Hangout.</p>

<p>In our case, we just get the video from the webcam
  with the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html">getUserMedia() function</a>.
  we dont need all the network part.
  It is quite widespread according <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream">caniuse</a> which is great!
  You can learn more about it
  on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia">mdn</a>
  or <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/">html5rocks</a></p>

<p>Now that we know how to get a video, which camera to pick ?
This demo is intended for phone. They often got multiple cameras nowsadays.
  typically a front camera for selfies
  a back camera for the normal photos.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack">MediaStreamTrack</a> will list all the media source available in your browser.
  In webrtc vocabulary,
  front camera is called &#8216;user&#8217; facing video
  back camera is a &#8216;environment&#8217; facing .
  So we try to get the environment video camera if we can.</p>

<p>For the see-through effect to be convincing, we need to be careful.
  first we display the video stream in full screen, thus it
  is more real to the user.
  We display it in the background of the page with the proper css
Additionally we ensure we keep a proper
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29">aspect ratio</a>,
  no matter the size of the browser window.
  So it isn&#8217;t streched.
So it must be robust to window resize and orientation change.
  All that makes the resize function more subtle than usual.
  but nothing dramatic</p>

<h2>Source</h2>

<p>Here is the full source of the effect.
It is in a <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/demo.seethroughphone">github repo</a>.
Enjoy!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>This is a new Three.js Online Meeting post. The idea is to interview people using <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> in their projects. I think it is a great way to learn from each other and share our experiences.  You know me, I love three.js and I love talking about it. In this video of about 1 hour you are gonna see some interesting people really passionate about games and three.js</p>

<p>For this interview, i talked with
<a href="https://twitter.com/jcfrog">JÃ©rÃ´me CHOAIN</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/_mig_">Michel Gutierrez</a>
, the guys behind <a href="https://www.jocly.com">Jocly Games</a>.
They have over 113 web board games with very cool features as you will see.  You can play on and off line with your friends, or just you and your computer. They also have some mobile apps that make their games even more accessible. You can dowload their games from <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/joclyfb/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Jocly">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/aclap/id512525676">iTunes</a>. And good news for developers: you can create and embed your own games! It is tons of fun. Be sure to check it out.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been nearly a month since I started publishing <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">&#8220;One threex a day&#8221; challenge</a>. The idea was to share with you the many <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extensions</a> that I had written over time. I wanted to show you how they could be useful, fun and easy to include in your very own three.js game. I came up with a motto &#8220;One threex a day gets your game on its way&#8221;. I was all set up and ready to go. This was a challenge inspired by John Resig&#8217;s article called <a href="http://ejohn.org/blo!/write-code-every-day/">&#8220;Write code everyday&#8221;</a>. I deeply agree with his theory for making progress, increasing productivity and getting the work done. I wished to try something similar on myself.</p>

<p>Let me tell you though&#8230; it WAS challenging! Keeping the publication rhythm was hard. It takes a lot of discipline and organization to get it done everyday. I had the best intentions, but unfortunately I got sick and I felt bad for most of last week. Additionally I had some day work on the side that I needed to get done. At this rate of publication, it was very hard to keep up! At first I wanted to publish the threex extensions for a period of two months but I think it is best to rest for a while. So a week ago I published the last three.js game extension of phase 1.</p>

<p>The good news is that I&#8217;ve had a very interesting experience. I&#8217;m pleased with the results. Obviously, some posts got more attention than others. I think this was because the three.js game extensions I published weren&#8217;t all for hard-core developers or game creators. Some were pretty basic, but still had educational value for people just starting with three.js. I wanted them to be directed to all kinds of audience, amateurs and experts alike. I really appreciated the process of sharing these extensions, and overall I had a great response. I got some <a href="https://plus.google.com/104300307601542851567/posts/RhabZY19TSq">very</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/104300307601542851567/posts/RqDbZNeJEkW">cool</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/siggraph/status/464238273582211072">retweets</a> and a lot of positive echo from you guys. Thanks a lot! Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me and give me some more feedback.</p>

<p>I stopped publication last week, but wait&#8230;I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m giving up though. Far from it. I have promised myself, and I promise my readers, to come back with more three.js extensions. Especially, because I still have a lot to publish, there are still some tricks up my sleeve ;)  For the moment I will concentrate on regaining my strength, writing more code and documenting it for the next threex batch. I hope to deliver and publish it soon.</p>

<p>Stay tuned! I&#8217;ll be back.</p>
