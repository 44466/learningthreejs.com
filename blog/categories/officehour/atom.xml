    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is to announce Three.js office hours. A practical and easy way to get answers to your questions.
The principle is simple: you post your questions on twitter with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23learningthreejs">#learningthreejs</a>
hashtag and we will try to answer them.</p>

<p>It is a direct channel for the three.js community.  We told ourselves that since our blog is about learning three.js, our mission is to coach and guide willing learners. We are starting it as an experiment, we will try it out and see how it goes. We noticed that people out there have many queries. Whether you are working with it as part of a project, or experimenting with it as a hobby, three.js can be tricky. We have been receiving emails and notifications with kind words (thank you for that!)... and a lot of questions too :) You expect answers and we want to deliver them.</p>

<p>So the idea behind Three.js office hours is to help you get around your troublesome issues. If you are stuck and don't understand something we encourage you to post your questions in the Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23learningthreejs">#learningthreejs</a>. If you have sent us queries before and we have overlooked them (sorry for that), please don't hesitate to ask about it on the hashtag.</p>

<p>We will then pick up questions that you guys posted and record a short video. We will answer them one by one, giving you detailed advice and useful pointers. In addition to that, we will write a blogpost about the content of the video, and publish it so you can come back to it whenever you want.</p>

<p>Thanks for participating in this experience with us. We are sure your questions will benefit the whole three.js community, so don't be shy!</p>

<p>There is always something new to learn ;)</p>
