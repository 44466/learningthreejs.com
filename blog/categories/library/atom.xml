    <id>http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/01/19/boilerplate-builder-for-three-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We recently introduced a
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate">boilerplate for three.js</a>
in a
<a href="/blog/2011/12/20/boilerplate-for-three-js/">previous post</a>.
It aims to ease your first contact with
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>.
It contains a template for a simple project,
a sample on which we already applied good practices.
You download it and run it in a matter of minutes.
Thus you can immediatly focus on your own things.
In short, it aims for <em>Fast bootstrap + Good Practices</em>.</p>

<p>It seems nice, hey ?
Well there is a glitch.
The
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate">boilerplate for three.js</a>
needs more flexibily.
In a way, it acts as a ground on top of which you start your own thing.
We do our best to provide good defaults, but they are only defaults.
What if you got specific requirements ?
How to start your project then ?
The
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/threejsboilerplatebuilder/">boilerplate builder</a>
has been written for you :)</p>

<p><a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/threejsboilerplatebuilder/">Try it out</a>.
Go ahead, play with the options,
discover what they do and customize your own boilerplate.
The
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANnPWZGRsGk">screencast</a>
below is short introduction where i describe the
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/threejsboilerplatebuilder/">boilerplate builder</a>.</p>

<h2>Making-Of the Builder</h2>

<p>The
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/threejsboilerplatebuilder/">builder</a>
itself was interesting to build.
It uses various nice features from the current web.
It is a pure-browser webapp with a file download,
a preview of a webgl project
and a nice looking visual appearance.</p>

<h3>Pure Browser Download</h3>

<p>I like to write pure-browser application.
They dont require a server to run, only static files.
It makes it much easier to host your application.
So
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/threejsboilerplatebuilder/">boilerplate builder</a>
has been written as a pure-browser application :)
It uses
<a href="http://jszip.stuartk.co.uk/">jszip</a>
, a library which create .zip files with Javascript.
Its creates the boilerplater.zip that you download.
Additionally, it uses
<a href="https://github.com/dcneiner/Downloadify">downloadify</a>
, a small library to create and download files without server.</p>

<p>Together,
<a href="http://jszip.stuartk.co.uk/">jszip</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/dcneiner/Downloadify">downloadify</a>
makes it easy to pack several files together,
and allow the user to download it.
All that in pure-browser, neat no?
I love what the web is becoming!</p>

<h3>Boilerplate Preview</h3>

<p>The preview is a bit different.
We start to load the <em>index.html</em> template for the boilerplate.
We apply all the options you configured and produce the final version.
To actually preview this file, we encode it in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a>
to build a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">data url</a>
with it.
Only then, we create an iframe with this data uri
and you can see the webgl preview :)</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">Data url</a>
is <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397">an old thing from 1998</a>
which is back in spotlight due to HTML5.
It allows to encode data directly in the URL.
It may be used to include image directly in css for examples.
Very usefull but not for human consumption.
To give you an idea, here is
<a href="http://pastebin.com/yF3XDSFW">index.html</a>
as a data url in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a>.
You could encode it as text if you
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI">escape</a>
it
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent">properly</a>.
It looks like long ugly random string.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>data:text/html;base64,PCFkb2N0eXBlIGh0....
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Visual Appearance</h3>

<p>It includes
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter bootstrap</a> for css.
I am quite grateful for this framework.
Without it, the
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/threejsboilerplatebuilder/">builder page</a>
will be so ugly, that people run away without even trying the application itself.
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter bootstrap</a>
makes it so easy to write a webapp which looks good on the screen.
I think all the css-impaired of the world should thanks twitter for this framework :)</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It has been quite fun to write it.
I learned some web skills,
discovered new part of three.js,
and on top of that, it looks good on screen.
I could not ask for more.
The goal of
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/threejsboilerplatebuilder/">boilerplate builder for three.js</a>
is to add more <em>flexibility</em> to the <em>fast bootstrap + good practices</em> from the
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate">boilerplate</a>.
I hope it will help people starting lots of new
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>
projects :)</p>

<p>That's all folks.
Have fun.</p>

    <id>http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/12/26/let-s-make-a-3d-game-virtual-joystick</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is another article of the "Let's Make a 3D Game"
<a href="/blog/categories/tutorial3dgame/">series</a>.
We have already seen how to handle other inputs like
<a href="/blog/2011/09/12/lets-Make-a-3D-game-keyboard/">keyboard</a>
and
<a href="/blog/2011/09/20/lets-make-a-3D-game-device-orientation/">device orientation</a>.
This post is about <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js">virtualjoystick.js</a>
It <strong>virtual joystick</strong>, another input you can use for your games.
A virtual joystick emulates a joystick behaviour on a touch screen.
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js">virtualjoystick.js</a>
has been coded in a effort to port
<a href="http://marblesoccer.com">marblesoccer</a>
to mobile device.
Show, dont tell,
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/virtualjoystick.js/">Try it out</a>.</p>

<p>This
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/virtualjoystick.js/">demo</a>
works with mouse events too thus, it is easier to test/debug.
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js">virtualjoystick.js</a>
has been widely inpired by
<a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/2011/04/multi-touch-game-controller-in-javascripthtml5-for-ipad/">this post</a>
by
<a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/">Seb Lee-Delisle</a>.
The screencast below is short introduction about
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js">virtualjoystick.js</a></p>

</center>


<h2>Let's Get Started</h2>

<p>First step, you download
<a href="https://raw.github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js/master/virtualjoystick.js">virtualjoystick.js</a>
from its
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js">github</a>
Then include it in your own code.</p>

<p>```html</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="virtualjoystick.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The joystick is composed of 2 parts: the <em>base</em> and the <em>stick</em>.
First the plare touch the screen, it gives the position of the <em>base</em>.
Then it drags its fingers to gives the position of the <em>stick</em></p>

<h2>Let's Use it</h2>

<iframe src="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/virtualjoystick.js/"
    webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen 
    width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em;">
</iframe>


<p>First step is to create the object from <code>VirtualJoystick</code> class.</p>

<p>```javascript</p>

<pre><code>var joystick = new VirtualJoystick()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The constructor has some options.
They have sensible default.
You can change them to fit your specific needs.
See
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js#readme">github README</a>
for a full API description.
You may look at the <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js/blob/master/index.html">index.html</a>.
It is an example which uses the library.</p>

<p>It is possible to read
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_stick">analogic</a>
coordinates.
 <code>joystick.deltaX()</code> gives the <em>delta x</em> between the base and the stick in pixel.
 <code>joystick.deltaY()</code> gives the <em>delta y</em>.
Those analogic coordinates may be interpreted as a
<a href="http://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/restrictors.html">joystick with 4 switches</a>.
Similar to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_keys">arrow keys</a>
in a way.
 <code>joystick.up()</code> tells you if your joystick is up or not.
You guessed the meaning of <code>.down()</code>, <code>.right()</code> and <code>.left()</code>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The source is available on
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js">github</a>
under MIT license.
Later, a button may be implemented as well.
It is alway usefull to able to fire in video games :)
That's all folks, have fun.</p>

    <link href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/12/20/boilerplate-for-three-js/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-20T19:09:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/12/20/boilerplate-for-three-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post presents
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate">boilerplate for three.js</a>.
I looked at
<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">html5 boilerplate</a>
and found
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMEB78VX2P0">it</a>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDlsOyPKUTM">awesome</a>.
<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">html5 boilerplate</a>
is a fast way start a clean project.
It avoids repetitive tasks, following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> principles.
It includes all those good practices, which are so easy to forget.
It seems all good to me :)
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate">boilerplate for three.js</a> tries to apply similar principles.
I frequently write simple three.js demo for tutorials, and repeat the first steps way too often for my tastes :)
It has been done in effort to make 3D on the web even easier.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/threejsboilerplate/">Try it</a> out.
"Boilerplate for three.js is a web template for a fast, robust and future-proof site.
Boilerplate is not a framework, nor does it prescribe any philosophy of
development, it's just got some tricks to get your project off the ground
quickly and right-footed."
- freely adapted from <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">html5 boilerplate site</a>.</p>

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<p>This project is at an early stage.
Dont hesitate to suggest improvements or
bug fixes in
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate/issues">github issues</a>.
It has been done to run everywhere, and to promote good practices.
The
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOReCN5t2Eo">screencast</a>
below will walk you through the source of the project.
22min... a long one :)</p>

<center>
    <iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kOReCN5t2Eo?hl=en&fs=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>


<h2>Compatibility is key</h2>

<p>It has to run everywhere.
We believe that compatibility is crucial on the web.
The boilerplate seamlessly works on desktop and mobile.
It is working on webgl/canvas2d and supports mouse/touch events.</p>

<p>It renders on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">webgl</a>
if available, else it fallbacks on
<a href="http://html5doctor.com/an-introduction-to-the-canvas-2d-api/">canvas2D</a>.
It is often forgotten, but <a href="">three.js</a> is able render on various backends,
they are called <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/src/renderers">renderers</a>.
It isnt always possible to fallback tho.
Materials are especially sensible to the type of renderer you use.
For examples, many materials are webgl specific as they contains shaders and canvas2D got no shaders.
Up to you to find the balance that fit your needs.</p>

<p>The camera controls is rather basic.
If you need a different controls for your camera, pick one in
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/src/extras/controls">this list</a>.
This one is simple to use and understand, a nice feature for a boilerplate.
It supports
<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_mouse.html">mouse events</a>
and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Touch_events">touch events</a>.
So you can run with a touch screen with a glitch.</p>

<h2>Good Practices</h2>

<p>Some features have been added: fullscreen, screenshot and window resize.
I consider them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice">good pratices</a> which are often forgotten.
Some numbers based on <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples">three.js examples</a>:
128 examples total,
26 of them handle touch events,
11 handle window resize,
2 handle screenshot,
0 handle fullscreen.</p>

<iframe src="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/threejsboilerplate"
    webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen 
    width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em;">
</iframe>


<p><strong>Fullscreen</strong> is supported to enjoy your 3D on a large display
without visual distraction.
If you press <em>f</em>, your demo will go fullscreen.
For technical details, see "<a href="/blog/2011/11/17/lets-make-a-3d-game-make-it-fullscreen/">Make It Fullscreen</a>" post.</p>

<p><strong>Screenshot</strong> makes it easy to share the image
as what you see on the screen at a given moment.
If you press <em>p</em>, a new tab will open with a screenshot of the rendered content.
For technical details, see "<a href="/blog/2011/09/03/screenshot-in-javascript/">screenhot in javascript</a>" post.
It it usefull to share nice images and to help debug on various plateforms.</p>

<p><strong>Window resize</strong> is supported because it is required. Without it, your 3D scene will loose scaleing and center
when you resize the window or go fullscreen.
For technical details, see "<a href="/blog/2011/08/30/window-resize-for-your-demos/">window resize your demos</a>" post.</p>

<h2>How to use it ?</h2>

<p>It is quite simple, first you download the code as
a <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate/zipball/master">.zip file</a>
or with the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> command line below.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate.git
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>then start updating <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate/blob/master/index.html">index.html</a> to
fit your needs.
Below is a screencast where i use the
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate">boilerplate</a>
to display a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot">teapot</a>
in only 3min!
Why a teapot ? Because it is the "hello world" of 3D :)
Be warned, the video is a bit speedy, im just starting at doing screencast.
Next ones will hopefully be slower.</p>

    <iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0XPOCi6FJX0?hl=en&fs=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Later, it may be cool to have a builder.
I think it may be possible to make it client only.
<a href="http://jszip.stuartk.co.uk/">jszip</a> library would create the zip containing all the files.
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/shorttag.js">shorttag.js</a> library would compile templates according to user needs.
A builder would produce a cleaner and smaller result for you to play with.</p>

<p>I gave a short talk at <a href="http://parisjs.org">parisjs</a> about it, here are the <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/slides-3jsbp-parisjs14">slides</a>.
I hope
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate">boilerplate for three.js</a>.
will help make
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>
even easier to use.
This project is quite new and will likely improve soon.
That's all folks, have fun :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is the second of our <a href="/blog/categories/particles">serie on particles</a>.
It presents
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/sparkseditor">sparkseditor</a>
, an online editor for
<a href="https://github.com/zz85/sparks.js">sparks.js</a>
with
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>.
In a few word, it is a webpage which provide an text editor
with a
<a href="https://github.com/zz85/sparks.js">sparks.js</a>
effect.
You got the code in the editor
and
you see <em>live</em> the resulting particles effect.
I like this <em>live</em> aspect a lot :)
I think it makes your design more direct, lower latency, less overhead.
More creative in a way.
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/sparkseditor/">Try it out</a>.</p>

<p>This editor has been made to lower the barrier of entry on
<a href="https://github.com/zz85/sparks.js">sparks.js</a>
with
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>
particles.
The UI is rather simple and obvious. You can find a small presentation in the
screencast below.</p>

<h2>Live editor rocks</h2>

<p><a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/sparkseditor/">Sparkseditor</a>
is widely inpired by
<a href="http://glsl.heroku.com/e">glsl editor</a>
from
<a href="http://mrdoob.com/">mrdoob</a>
and
<a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/apps/shadertoy/">shadertoy</a>
from
<a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/">Inigo Quilez</a>.
On the same vibe,
<a href="http://lea.verou.me/">lea verou</a>
recently
released
<a href="http://lea.verou.me/2011/12/introducing-dabblet-an-interactive-css-playground/">dablet</a>,
an online editor for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">css</a>.
There is a clear trend here...
What is it about those live editors ?
A live editor produces a result immediatly.
This helps design your effect faster.
Be light on your foot kindof style.
Very agile way to design.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is easy to share with others because we have <em>bookmarkability</em>.
We do that by storing state in url.
On the down side, it makes super long+ugly urls...
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening">url shortening</a>
helps us reduces this issue.
In our case, we use
<a href="https://bitly.com/">bitly</a>
service.</p>

<p>This editor is purely static files.
No specific server to run, no need to admin and no risk to go offline.
Oh and by the way i dont not even have to pay for hosting this application.
I think it shows html5 in all its power.
The web is becoming something real nice :) html5 i love you!</p>

<h2>conclusion</h2>

<p>Under the hood,
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/sparkseditor">sparkseditor</a>
uses
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex/blob/master/threex.sparks.js">threex.sparks.js</a>, a
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex">threex</a>
helper, to make
<a href="https://github.com/zz85/sparks.js/">sparks.js</a>
even easier to use.
This helper will be the subject of a future post of our

It specifically is about
<a href="https://github.com/zz85/sparks.js">sparks.js</a>.
<em>sparks.js</em> is lightweight 3d

Go dig in it to understand how to code three.js :)
Back to the point, this
<a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/examples/webgl_particles_shapes.html">demo</a>
is rather cool no ?
You want to do the same ?
During this short post, let me walk you walk thru the code for particles in this example.</p>

<h2>Lets Get Started</h2>

<p>So lets see how to use it. First step, you download
<a href="https://raw.github.com/zz85/sparks.js/master/Sparks.js">sparks.js</a>
from
<a href="https://github.com/zz85/sparks.js">its github</a>.
Then include it in your own code.</p>

<p>```html</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="Sparks.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>First a few words on what is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_system">particle system</a>.
It is usually composed of 2 big parts: the <em>emitter</em> and the <em>particle</em> itself.
Emitter creates particles.
Particles are usually smallish objects on the screen.
As you got many particles at the same time, they appears a single mass.</p>

<h2>Let's create an emitter</h2>

<p>First we create the emitter like this.
 <code>emitter</code> is the main object we will play with.</p>

<p>```javascript</p>

<pre><code>var counter = new SPARKS.SteadyCounter( 500 );
var emitter = new SPARKS.Emitter( counter );
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p> <code>counter</code> controls how frequently particles are created. Here it will
emit 500 particles per seconds.
Now let's start emit particles.</p>

<p>```javascript</p>

<pre><code>emitter.start();
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Sparks.js has a very flexible core.
It mainly uses two stacks of functions.
<em>Initializers</em> is the stack run at the creation of a particle.
<em>Actions</em> is another stack which is run at every step of a particle life.
Those functions are run in order.
Up to you to configure them to fit your needs.
You can easily code your own <em>initializer</em> or <em>action</em>.
Dont worry it got a bunch of predefined ones.</p>

<h2>Let's initialize</h2>

<p>Lets me walk you thru the ones used in our example. The whole stack is below.
 <code>emitter.addInitializer()</code> to push a new initializer, and <code>emitter.removeInitializer()</code>
to remove it, not too hard :)</p>

<p>```javascript</p>

<pre><code>emitterpos = new THREE.Vector3( 0, 0, 0 );
emitter.addInitializer( new SPARKS.Position( new SPARKS.PointZone( emitterpos ) ) );
emitter.addInitializer( new SPARKS.Lifetime( 1, 15 ));
var vector = new THREE.Vector3( 0, -5, 1 );
emitter.addInitializer( new SPARKS.Velocity( new SPARKS.PointZone( vector ) ) );
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p> <code>SPARKS.Position(zone)</code> initializer set the original position of the particle.
A <code>zone</code> provide a location in space.
 <code>new SPARKS.PointZone( emitterpos )</code> means the particles will always start from this specific point in space.
It is possible to have other zones.
For example, <code>SPARKS.LineZone( startVector3, endVector3 )</code> represents a line between 2 points, so
your particle would start anywhere on this line.</p>

<p> <code>SPARKS.Lifetime(mintime, maxtime)</code> initializer set particle's lifetime.
You can specify a range and a random value will be assigned.
Don't forget to add <code>SPARKS.Age</code> action to handle its lifetime.
And the last one.
 <code>SPARKS.Velocity(zone)</code> set particle's velocity based on a <code>zone</code> location.
The initializer stack is setup the particle at the begining of its life.
Let's see what happen during this life.</p>

<h2>Let's do some actions</h2>

<p>Actions are performed at every step of a particle life.
Same as with initializers, <code>emitter.addAction()</code> to push a new action,
 <code>emitter.removeAction()</code> to remove it.
For our examples the whole action stack is this.</p>

<p>```javascript</p>

<pre><code>emitter.addAction( new SPARKS.Age() );
emitter.addAction( new SPARKS.Accelerate( 0, 0, -50 ) );
emitter.addAction( new SPARKS.Move() );
emitter.addAction( new SPARKS.RandomDrift( 90, 100, 2000 ) );
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now lets details it.
We have already seen <code>SPARKS.Age()</code>. It is handle the lifetime of each particle.
 <code>SPARKS.Accelerate(x,y,z)</code> changes the velocity by adding a fixed amount at every step.
This one produces a gravity effect with a negative <code>y</code>.
 <code>SPARKS.Move()</code> makes the particles move in our 3D space.
 <code>SPARKS.RandomDrift(x,y,z)</code> changes the velocity by adding a random amount at every step.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope this short introduction got you excited about
<a href="https://github.com/zz85/sparks.js/">sparks.js</a>.
Next posts on the
<a href="/blog/categories/particles">particle series</a>
may be a UI editor, stay tuned!
I find sparks.js clean and flexible.
Flexibility is very important for particles.
It helps provide a wide variety of effect in your games/demos.
