This is post is part of the <a href="/blog/categories/threexaday/">'one threex a day' challenge</a>. This challenge is to publish every day one game extension for three.js! One per day, every day and that for 2month! In this post, we gonna talk about <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.oimo">threex.oimo</a>.
threex.oimo is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">threex game extension for three.js</a>. It provides a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_physics">realistic physics</a> easy to include in your own games. So you can take objects in your game and make them fall as if it was the real world! You can code a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_(cue_sports)">pool game</a> in a day!
You make rocks fall from the sky in a realistic fashion! Sky is the limit!
It is a warper over the excelent library <a href="https://github.com/lo-th/Oimo.js">oimo.js</a> physics library. <a href="https://plus.google.com/114170447432405103307/posts">lo-th</a>, the author does <a href="http://3dflashlo.wordpress.com/">a lot of crazy things</a>!

<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<p><code>
 &lt;script src='threex.oimo.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<p><code>
bower install threex.oimo
</code></p>

<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<p>Well first you need to create a oimo.js world. You do that like this</p>

<p><code>
var world   = new OIMO.World()
</code></p>

<p>Then, at every frame, update your mesh position/rotation.</p>

<p><code>
world.step()
</code></p>

<p>Then you need to create physics bodies and make them move</p>

<h2>.createBodyFromMesh()</h2>

<p>It will create the <code>IOMO.Body</code> from a three.js mesh you give it.
Currently it support <code>THREE.CubeGeometry</code> and <code>THREE.SphereGeometry</code>. First create a normal <code>THREE.Mesh</code></p>

<p><code>
var geometry    = new THREE.CubeGeometry(1,1,1)
var material    = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial()
var mesh    = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material )
scene.add(mesh)
</code></p>

<p>Then you create the <code>IOMO.Body</code> for it</p>

<p><code>
var body    = THREEx.Iomo.createBodyFromMesh(world, mesh)
</code></p>

<h2>.Body2MeshUpdater()</h2>

<p>It will update the position/rotation of a <code>THREE.Mesh</code>
based on a position/rotation of a <code>IOMO.Body</code>. You need
this to see your meshes moves according to oimo.js physics.
First you create the object</p>

<p><code>
var updater = new THREEx.Iomo.Body2MeshUpdater(body, mesh)
</code></p>

<p>Then, at every frame, update your mesh position/rotation.</p>

<p><code>
updater.update()
</code></p>

<h2>.Stats()</h2>

<p>It will display statistic from oimo.js, it may be useful to know what is going on.
It acts very much like
<a href="">mrdoob's stats</a>
or
<a href="">threex.rendererstats</a>.</p>

<p><code>
var oimoStats   = new THREEx.Iomo.Stats(world)
document.body.appendChild(oimoStats.domElement)
</code></p>

<p>Then, at every frame, update it.</p>

<p><code>
oimoStats.update()
</code></p>

<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.crates">threex.crates</a>.
threex.crates is a <a href="http://www.threejsgame.com/extensions/">threex game extension for three.js</a>.
It provides <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crate">crates</a> models, 3 of them to be accurate.
Yeah you heard me, this is only boxes of wood. Why doing an extension for that?
Well, because crates are like a myth in 3d graphics, we put them everywhere.
So if you need crates to easily put in your game, you know where to find them now :)</p>

One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.coloradjust">threex.coloradjust</a>.
threex.coloradjust is a
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">threex game extension for three.js</a>.
It provides a color adjustement in post processing.
It happens on the whole screen and changes every colors giving a whole new ambiance to your games.
It includes smooth transitions between each ambiance.
There are 22 ambiances going from 'sepia', to 'thermal', or 'radioactive'.
I highly recommend 'nightvision' if your game is about fps shooting at night!
It is very flexible, you can build your own ambiance with any image editing software.
It is ported from
<a href="http://webglsamples.googlecode.com/hg/color-adjust/color-adjust.html">color-adjust demo</a>
by
<a href="http://greggman.com/">greggman</a>.
Here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQ8rKGTVlg#t=25m03s">video</a>
where you can see greggman explaining the underlying technic.
It explains how to do 3d texture in webgl! :)</p>

<p><code>bash
bower install threex.coloradjust
</code></p>

<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<p>It build the passes for the color effect.
It exposes <code>colorPass.colorPass</code> for a <code>THREE.EffectComposer</code> instance.</p>

<p>Create an instance</p>

<p><code>
var colorPasses = new THREEx.ColorAdjust.Passes();
</code></p>

<p>Everytime you render the scene, be sure to update it</p>

<p><code>
colorPasses.update(delta, now)      
</code></p>

<p>Then you add those passes to an <code>THREE.EffectComposer</code> like that</p>

<p><code>
colorPasses.addPassesTo(composer)
</code></p>

<h3>Tuning</h3>

<p>This module comes with a set of predefined <em>color cubes</em> : 22 of them to be exact.
You can set the color cube you want: one of the 22 already provided, or your own.
It default to <code>default</code>.
Here is the full list of available colors adjustement : default,
monochrome,
sepia,
saturated,
posterize,
inverse,
color-negative,
high-contrast-bw,
funky-contrast,
nightvision,
thermal,
black-white,
hue-plus-60,
hue-plus-180,
hue-minus-60,
red-to-cyan,
blues,
infrared,
radioactive,
goolgey,
bgy.</p>

<p><code>javascript
// set color adjustement to 'nightvision'
colorPasses.setColorCube('nightvision')
</code></p>

<p>There is a smooth linear transition between the old colorCube and the new colorCube.
You can tune the delay like this.</p>

<p><code>javascript
// set the transition delay to 2 seconds
colorPasses.delay   = 2;
</code></p>

    <updated>2014-04-22T17:51:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody! I’m working on a new project that I want to share with you. But first, let me start by telling you what inspired me to do it.</p>

<p>Last week, I read an interesting article written by John Resig called <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/">Write code everyday</a>. He explains how he succeed in efficiently accomplishing his side projects. This article opened my eyes. It was like a revelation, a procedure that I just had to apply to my own work. An answer to the questions I had been asking myself: How could I be more efficient? How could I be more disciplined and improve my execution?</p>

<p>The tactic that Resig decided to practice to improve his productivity was quite simple: He tried working on his side projects a little everyday, for a delimited amount of time, and it worked! He didn’t feel like a failure when he didn't do enough "quality" work during the weekend anymore! He found a way to organize his schedule, do his work, while still devoting time to leisure activities. I find this amazingly intelligent!</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://learningthreejs.com//www.youtube.com/embed/CShTdamWAzg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Resig’s work inspired me. So, I wanna try to do something similar: I want to publish a three.js game extension every day! Yes I know, it’s a challenge! But I wanna see if Resig’s tactic helps me gain more discipline when publishing my code. The idea is to publish one every day of the week, from Monday to Friday, one per day for two months, except on the weekends, because well, one has to rest at some point :)</p>

<p>Ok, so you already know that I love three.js, a javascript 3D library that makes Webgl. Three.js is the new up and coming technology, it’s hot, cutting-edge, and it has been deployed worldwide. Well, now I would really love to help you write your own games with it! I think the best way to do this is by publishing one three.js game extension per day. I have an enormous amount of information, and code, to share with you. I just have to get it out there for you to see!</p>

<p>Three.js Game extensions will make the dream of developing your own 3d video game come true. My moto is <strong>“One threex per day, gets your game on it’s way!”</strong> I’ve got over <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">40 cool extensions</a> that could be used to facilitate the development of 3D games on the web. And I wanna share this knowledge with the world!</p>

<p><a href='http://jeromeetienne.github.io/stellar7/' target='_blank'><img class="right" src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2014-04-22-one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/images/stellar7-screenshot.png" width="444" height="250"></a>
Most of the three.js game extensions that I will publish support require.js and it would be very easy to add them to your own game. With these extensions you can actually learn to code 3D mini-games in less than an hour, like <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/01/10/flying-spaceship-minigame/">Flying Spaceships</a> or to create more detailed video games with a lot of cool post-processing effects, like <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/stellar7/">Stellar7</a>. Just to give you an idea, I coded Stellar7 in only 2 weeks thanks to threex extensions! That's a record :)</p>

<p>The three.js game extensions will teach you real skills and tools to help you develop cool stuff on 3D. The best part is that you can reproduce everything you learn cause it’s all open source and available to anyone!</p>

<p>The Three.Js Games mission is to ignite the spark of genius creativity that every developer has.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it :)</p>

<p>That’s all folks!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about a demo called <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/demo.seenyourselfdrunk">"Have you seen yourself When you are Drunk ?"</a>. What is it all about ?
Well have you seen yourself when you are drunk ?</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/data/2014-02-08-have-you-seen-yourself-when-you-are-drunk/images/angryBoss.jpg" width="250" height="250"></p>

<p>You don't look at your best, but you don't remember the morning after, lucky you. So now you are sober, this demo will show you how you look when you are drunk…
Hopefully this will make you realize that <em>alcohol abuse is a bad thing</em>! And that we could
<em>save the world by stopping it</em>!</p>

<p><a href='http://jeromeetienne.github.io/demo.seenyourselfdrunk/' target='_blank'><input type="button" value='Try Demo Now' /></a></p>

<p>Or it will just show some cool webgl effects… Honnestly i wasnt that sure of its exact purpose. Well, up to you to pick :)
In other words, this is a webgl demo which reads your webcam, to show yourself on screen, then it does some screen deformations to give you an idea of what you look like when you are drunk.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://learningthreejs.com//www.youtube.com/embed/yl2Qd9T3Lq4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>We will learn how to code that. So first the tools of the trade…</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Used Tools</h2>

<p>This demo is done with 2 threex extensions
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.toxicpproc">threex.toxicpproc</a>
,
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.videotexture">threex.videotexture</a>
and our lovely
<a href="http://threejs.org">three.js</a> obviously.
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.videotexture">threex.videotexture</a>
is, according to <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex/#threex.videotexture">threex page</a> :</p>

<blockquote><p>handles videos in texture. It is possible to put html5 video output in texture, even put the webcam in it, or to connect it to WebAudio API to get localized sounds.</p></blockquote>

<p>We will use it to read the webcam and display it full page.
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.toxicpproc">threex.toxicpproc</a>
is, according to <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex/#threex.toxicpproc">threex page</a> :</p>

<blockquote><p>an intoxicated post-processing effect. You can easily add it in your game to simulate the player is drunk. It provides various levels: sober, drunk, high and wasted.</p></blockquote>

<p>We will use it to deform the video from the webcam and makes you look drunk.</p>

<h2>Webcam For Texture</h2>

<p>So the first thing is to get webcam on fullpage.
For that we use <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.videotexture">threex.videotexture</a>.
It does video textures, either you take this video from a url, like this.</p>

<p>```
// create the videoTexture
var videoUrl    = 'sintel.ogv';
var videoTexture= new THREEx.VideoTexture(videoUrl)
// on every render, update it
onRenderFcts.push(function(delta, now){</p>

<pre><code>    videoTexture.update(delta, now)
</code></pre>

<p>})
```</p>

<p>Or you take the video live from the webcam, like this.</p>

<p>```
// create the webcamTexture
var videoTexture    = new THREEx.WebcamTexture()
// on every render, update it
onRenderFcts.push(function(delta, now){</p>

<pre><code>    videoTexture.update(delta, now)
</code></pre>

<p>})<br/>
```</p>

<p>Then use <code>videoTexture.texture</code> in your materials to
have the texture of the webcam. So let's see how we will
compose our scene.</p>

<h2>Scene Composition</h2>

<p>We need a Plane which take the full page, and we will apply our webcam texture to it.
So first there is an orthographic camera. Perspective is useless in this case, and make computations much more complex :)</p>

<p>```
var camera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(window.innerWidth / -2, window.innerWidth / 2</p>

<pre><code> ,  window.innerHeight / 2, window.innerHeight / -2, -100, 100);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Then, there is a <code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code> mesh
using full screen for this camera.</p>

<p><code>
var geometry    = new THREE.PlaneGeometry( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight )
var material    = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial();
var mesh    = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
scene.add(mesh)
</code></p>

<p>Then we apply our <code>videoTexture</code> to this material. Thus
we see the webcam on this plan :)</p>

<p><code>
material.map    = videoTexture.texture
</code></p>

<p>So we got our face on full screen, cool for ego i guess :)
Now let's apply some deformation to it!</p>

<h2>Post Processing and Rendering</h2>

<p>Usually to render a scene, we use the following code.
This is when we render the scene directly on screen.</p>

<p><code>
renderer.render( scene, camera )
</code></p>

<p>We will use a post processing chain with <code>THREE.EffectComposer</code>. It process the screen as a 2d texture.
More specifically, we will use <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.toxicpproc">threex.toxicpproc</a>, a three.js extension which provide post processing of drunk effects. It got 4 presets <em>sober</em>, <em>drunk</em>, <em>high</em> and <em>wasted</em>. There is a nice tweening when you switch between presets so transitions looks smooth.
Try it yourself in <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.toxicpproc/examples/basic.html">this demo</a>.</p>

<h3>THREEx.ToxicPproc</h3>

<p>So First lets instanciate a <code>THREEx.ToxicPproc.Passes</code>. It will setup the effect composers passes for our effect. We set it to the <code>drunk</code> preset.</p>

<p>```
var toxicPasses = new THREEx.ToxicPproc.Passes('drunk')
// on every render you update it
onRenderFcts.push(function(delta, now){</p>

<pre><code>toxicPasses.update(delta, now)
</code></pre>

<p>})
```</p>

<p>If you want to create other presets, it is entirely possible. There is even a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/">Dat.GUI</a> provided for you to tweak buttons until it fits your needs. You see it in <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.toxicpproc/examples/basic.html">the demo</a>.
You use it like this.</p>

<p><code>
var datGui  = new dat.GUI()
THREEx.addToxicPasses2DatGui(toxicPasses, datGui)
</code></p>

<h3>THREE.EffectComposer</h3>

<p>Now that we got the toxicpproc passes, let's create the <code>THREE.EffectComposer</code> to run it.</p>

<p><code>
var composer    = new THREE.EffectComposer(renderer);
</code></p>

<p>We render the scene on a texture</p>

<p><code>
var renderPass  = new THREE.RenderPass( scene, camera );
composer.addPass( renderPass );
</code></p>

<p>We send this texture to <code>threex.toxicpproc</code></p>

<p><code>
toxicPasses.addPassesTo(composer)
</code></p>

<p>Now we just have to tell the composer the last pass is the one to be rendered on screen.</p>

<p><code>
composer.passes[composer.passes.length -1 ].renderToScreen  = true;
</code></p>

<h3>Update on each Frame</h3>

<p>We got the rendering to do on each frame. Usually we do</p>

<p><code>
renderer.render( scene, camera )
</code></p>

<p>But here we render thru the effect composer, so we do</p>

<p><code>
// render thru composer
composer.render(delta)
</code></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Ok so you have learn how to code a demo like
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/demo.seenyourselfdrunk">"Have you seen yourself When you are Drunk ?"</a>
Pretty Cool!
Now you can get more <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex/">threex</a> extensions and
play with it to build your own demos.
This is All for Today Folks, have fun! :)</p>
