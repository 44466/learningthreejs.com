    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is to announce Three.js office hours. A practical and easy way to get answers to your questions.
The principle is simple: you post your questions on twitter with #learningthreejs <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23learningthreejs">#learningthreejs hashtag</a>
and we will try to answer them.</p>

<p>It is a direct channel for the three.js community.  We told ourselves that since our blog is about learning three.js, our mission is to coach and guide willing learners. We are starting it as an experiment, we will try it out and see how it goes. We noticed that people out there have many queries. Whether you are working with it as part of a project, or experimenting with it as a hobby, three.js can be tricky. We have been receiving emails and notifications with kind words (thank you for that!)... and a lot of questions too :) You expect answers and we want to deliver them.</p>

<p>So the idea behind Three.js office hours is to help you get around your troublesome issues. If you are stuck and don't understand something we encourage you to post your questions in the Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23learningthreejs">#learningthreejs</a>. If you have sent us queries before and we have overlooked them (sorry for that), please don't hesitate to ask about it on the hashtag.</p>

<p>We will then pick up questions that you guys posted and record a short video. We will answer them one by one, giving you detailed advice and useful pointers. In addition to that, we will write a blogpost about the content of the video, and publish it so you can come back to it whenever you want.</p>

<p>Thanks for participating in this experience with us. We are sure your questions will benefit the whole three.js community, so don't be shy!</p>

<p>There is always something new to learn ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody</p>

<p>Welcome to a new episode of Three.js News. This time we will discover some artistic and abstract demos. We will go through them at fast speed, see them grow, expand and dissolve. We will also get a bit spooked by a creepy head!</p>

<h3>Bjork's website</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/bjork.jpg" alt="bjork" /></p>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/meander.jpg" alt="meander" /></p>

<p><a href="http://codedoodl.es/_/inconvergent/meander">Meander</a> consists of randomly generated organic sand-storm clouds that dance around the screen. Its author, <a href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent">Anders Hoff</a> shared this via <a href="http://codedoodl.es/">Codedoodl</a> a tool to create original code sketches.</p>

<h3>Arrows</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/arrows.jpg" alt="arrows" /></p>

<p>Like a painting in a canvas, this <a href="http://codedoodl.es/_/cabbibo/arrows">demo</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Cabbibo">Cabbibo</a> is abstract and bursting with colour. The arrows wander around like small brush strokes in 3D. You can also find it at <a href="http://codedoodl.es/">Codedoodl</a>.</p>

<h3>Signal barrel</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/signal_barrel.jpg" alt="signal_barrel" /></p>

<p><a href="http://codepen.io/austinmayer/full/oXRGez/">Signal barrel</a> is a demo created by <a href="https://twitter.com/amayer_">Austin Mayer</a> and inspired by a similar project by <a href="https://twitter.com/beeple">Beeple</a>. It is a very cool tunnel like recreation on <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>. You will want to follow it 'til the end.</p>

<h3>Fungal State</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/fungal_state.jpg" alt="fungal_state" /></p>

<p>This evolutive <a href="http://gregtatum.com/poems/growth/#/2-fungus">demo</a> was created by the talented <a href="https://twitter.com/TatumCreative">Greg Tatum</a>. It shows us a dynamic and realtime growing fungus shape. It is part of Greg's <a href="http://gregtatum.com/blog/">Growth series</a>.</p>

<h3>Creepy Head</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/creepy_head.jpg" alt="creepy_head" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://codepen.io/SaschaSigl/full/MwMOag/">demo</a> is a creepy morph animation made with javascript. It was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/SaschaSigl">Sascha Sigl</a> on <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>. The way the mouth moves and the eyes follow you is kind of disturbing and spooky :)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Okay guys, that's all the news for this week. We discovered some very artistic, abstract and fast paced projects. Some evolving and expanding, morphing and growing...and some freaking us out! In any case, they are all creative and fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is another edition of Three.js News. We have collected some original demos with skilful effects and lots of style. There is a high degree of talent displayed on these projects. In this episode, we will cycle through the daring climbs of the Tour de France. We will turn around decadent blue worlds, play with colourful Rubik's cube and take the new Renault Espace for a test run. We will also merge and morph with creative experiences and investigate fascinating generative compositions.</p>

<h3>Metropolis</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/metropolis.jpg" alt="metropolis" /></p>

<p><a href="https://alexstockdale.com/metropolis/">Metropolis</a> is an impressive demo by <a href="https://twitter.com/ALIXPLOX">Alex Stockdale</a>. It is a spheric vision of an urban world in destruction, or construction, depending on how you see it. It has a decadent aspect to it, the light is like the shadow of a dream and there is a hazy bluish shade in the atmosphere. This project is not only interactive and skilful but it is also a great example of what we can do with three.js.</p>

<h3>The Climb of Alpe d'Huez</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/the_climb_alpe_huez.jpg" alt="the_climb_alpe_huez" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2015/jul/23/tour-de-france-the-climb-of-alpe-dhuez-interactive">demo</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/amason">Andrew Mason</a>, Troy Griggs and Lawrence Ostlere, is a 3D representation of the Tour de France. We cycle a trail following the iconic Alpe d'huez climb. Step by step we learn about its history, about details of the trickiest passings and challenges to get to the summit....wonderful work by the talented devs at the guardian!</p>

<h3>Roobix</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/roobix.jpg" alt="roobix" /></p>

<p><a href="http://playcanv.as/p/V9B7k46n">Roobix</a> is a very fun game created by <a href="https://twitter.com/marquizzo">Marco del Valle</a> on <a href="https://playcanvas.com/">Play Canvas</a>. It is a Rubik's cube simulator with great animations. The rotations and puzzle combinations are extremely fun to play with. The cube is very reactive and the twinkling colours are part of the features that make this game unique.</p>

<h3>Renault Espace</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/renault_espace.jpg" alt="renault_espace" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.littleworkshop.fr/renaultespace/">demo</a> is an interactive prototype of the New Renault Space by <a href="https://twitter.com/glecollinet">Guillaume Collinet</a>. It is a webgl visualizer using real time 3d. You can go inside the car as if you were gonna take it out for a test drive. The interior and animations are life-like and will make you feel like you own it! You can visit Guillaume's <a href="http://www.littleworkshop.fr/">little workshop</a> for more stylish experiences.</p>

<h3>Omm Experience</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/omm_experience.jpg" alt="omm_experience" /></p>

<p><a href="http://ommexperience.com/">Omm Experience</a> shows us the fantastic world created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jhelf">Jean Helfenstein</a>. At first, there is an awesome lens flare effect with a halo of light glowing around a revolving asteroid. As the demo evolves, there are 3 chapters about creativity with great morphing and merging animations that transform and deform the object as if it was a ball of water.</p>

<h3>Gridiron</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/gridiron.jpg" alt="gridiron" /></p>

<p><a href="http://haptic-data.com/project/gridiron">Gridiron</a> is "an exploration of generative compositions based on vertical structures fighting for space" developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hapticdata">Kyle Phillips</a>. We can see procedurally generated geometries that rain up and fill the screen. We can also modify their properties and play with the effects. It kind of reminds me of chemistry class.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this edition of Three.js News we saw the talent behind daring and challenging experiences like the Tour de France, behind life-like animations and reactive games like Rubik's cube. We floated through procedurally generated worlds and through spheric decadent visions of a city. We took a drive around our imagination and witnessed creativity in its abstract form.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing. Stay tuned for more Three.js News and see you next time.</p>
