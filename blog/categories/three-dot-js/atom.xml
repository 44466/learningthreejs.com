This challenge is to publish every day one game extension for three.js!
One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.cubecamera">threex.cubecamera</a>.
threex.cubecamera is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> which provides a helper for cube cameras. It is very useful when a given object must reflect a texture cube live. Just look at it, you can see the reflection as clear as a real life mirror! You can give your texture the color you want, for example in the demo I created a "gold" sphere to give it a shinier look. Be careful though, this requires 6 renderings of the scene every time you update it. It becomes expensive fast.</p>

It shows a little bit shinier discoball.
TODO to port in its own demo.
It doesnt even use live rendering.
Use the "minecraft goes party" from nextgamefrontier talk.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<p>```html</p>

<script src='threex.cubecamera.js'></script>


<p>```</p>

<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<p><code>bash
bower install threex.cubecamera
</code></p>

<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<p>First you need to create a classic mesh, the one which gonna reflect the live texture cube.
In this example, we gonna create sphere with the color 'gold' like this.</p>

<p>```
var geometry    = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.5, 32, 16)
var material    = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({</p>

<pre><code>color   : 'gold'
</code></pre>

<p>})
var mesh    = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
scene.add( mesh ) <br/>
```</p>

<p>Now we needs to create the cube camera which gonna update the texture cube live.
We do that like this.</p>

<p><code>
var cubeCamera  = new THREEx.CubeCamera(mesh)
scene.add(cubeCamera.object3d)
</code></p>

<p>Don't forget to update it when needed (likely at every frame)</p>

<p><code>
cubeCamera.update(renderer, scene)
</code></p>

<p>Now that we got the textureCube, we set the mesh material to reflect this texture cube.</p>

<p><code>
material.envMap = cubeCamera.textureCube
</code></p>

<p>This is it! Now you got the live texture cube on your sphere :)</p>

In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.suzanne">threex.suzanne</a>.
Suzanne is a classic. She is the blender famous model familiar to all blender users. It is also a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> extension which provides you with a monkey model. Blender wanted to create a less common test model, so Suzanne was born. She is more precisely a 3D model of a chimpanzee head. It is pretty basic but you can easily add it as a funky animal character and install it in your platform games!</p>

</code></p>

<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<h3>How to load the geometry ?</h3>

<p>```javascript
new THREEx.Suzanne.GeometryLoader(function onLoad(geometry){</p>

<pre><code>// this function is notified when the geometry is actually loaded

// geometry is a THREE.Geometry of suzanne model
</code></pre>

<p>})
```</p>

<h3>How to create a mesh with it ?</h3>

<p>```javascript
new THREEx.Suzanne.GeometryLoader(function onLoad(geometry){</p>

<pre><code>// create a mesh with the geometry
var material    = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial()
var mesh    = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material )
// attach mesh to the scene
scene.add(mesh)
</code></pre>

<p>})
```</p>

<p>Sometime it is not desirable to wait for the loading to complete before
adding the object to the scene. To avoid this, we create a container
which will contains the model once loading is completed.
Thanks to the scene graph inheritance, any position/quaternion/scale
changes made on container, will be reported to the children meshes.</p>

<p>```javascript
// create the container
var container   = new THREE.Object3D();
// add the container to the scene without waiting the end of loading
scene.add(container)
// start to load the geometry
new THREEx.Suzanne.GeometryLoader(function onLoad(geometry){</p>

<pre><code>// create a mesh with it
var material    = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial()
var mesh    = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material )
// attach mesh to the container
container.add(mesh)
</code></pre>

<p>})

threex.vertexanimation is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> which provides easy vertex animation. You can see your object move as if it's got a life of its own! You can use it to make the objects in your game bounce, dance or move in funky ways. You can add it in your games to get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flubber_(film)">Flubber</a> effect. The best part about it is that you can get creative. You can morph or deform your objects to transform them into other objects. It is really fun to experiment with!</p>

<p>Hello everybody! This is my first <em>Three.js Interview</em> video. The inspiration came from all those great people out there doing <a href="http://threejs.org">very cool projects with three.js</a>. I want to share their innovations with others. If you know me, you know that I love talking about three.js. So, I would like everybody to have the opportunity to enjoy and learn from these <a href="/blog/categories/threejsInterview/">three.js interviews</a>. So three.js interviews are videos of around one hour where people are talking about cool things they do with three.js . Maybe you could get some ideas for your own project or simply partake on a subject you're passionate about.</p>

<p><a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709928' target='_blank'><input type="button" value='discuss it on hacker news' /></a></p>

<p><img class="left" src="/data/2014-05-07-threejs-interview-online-3d-modeling-and-rendering-with-claraio/images/image03.jpg" width="320" height="240"></p>

<p>The idea is to have interesting people come and talk about cool things that they've done with three.js. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/BenAtExocortex">Ben Houston</a>, who is our guest in this first video. Ben is the Team Leader for <a href="http://clara.io/">Clara.io</a>, a online 3D modeling and rendering tool that you can use inside you browser. Ben talks to us about the creation and the evolution of <a href="http://clara.io/">Clara.io</a> and about all the interesting features it's got!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it and stay tuned for the next Three.js Interview :)</p>

threex.md2character is a
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js game extension</a>
which provides a model of a monster.
His name is 'ratmahatta' and is from quake era.
It is animated, can hold a weapon, skin may be changed. Pretty sweet.
you got <strong>12 weapons to choose from</strong>, <strong>5 different skins</strong> and <strong>16 distinct animations</strong>. Pretty complete!
It is easy to include in your game, maybe in a cave or a dungeon :)
It is from
<a href="http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_morphtargets_md2.html">webgl_morphtargets_md2.html three.js example</a>.
The model is make by

It shows how to controls the mesh as if it was a player in a game with input
in the keyboard wasd or arrows keys.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<p>```html</p>

<script src='threex.md2character.js'></script>


<p>```</p>

<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<p><code>bash
bower install threex.md2character
</code></p>

<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<h2>threex.md2characterratmahatta.js</h2>

<p>You typically create a ratamahatta like this</p>

<p><code>
var ratamahatta = new THREEx.MD2CharacterRatmahatta()
scene.add(ratamahatta.character.object3d)
</code></p>

<p>Don't forget to update it when you render with <code>ratamahatta.update(delta)</code>.Internally, it create a character and a controls. You can use them directly.
* <code>ratamahatta.character</code> instance of <code>THREEx.MD2Character</code>
* <code>ratamahatta.controls</code> instance of <code>THREEx.MD2CharacterControls</code></p>

<p>It has simple functions to set the skin, weapon and animations.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ratamahatta.skinNames</code> is the names of available skins. It has 5 different skins <code>["ratamahatta", "ctf_b", "ctf_r", "dead", "gearwhore"]</code></li>
<li><code>ratamahatta.setSkinName(skinName)</code> set the skin based on its name</li>
<li><code>ratamahatta.weaponsNames</code> is the names of available weapons. It has 12 animation <code>["none", "weapon", "w_bfg", "w_blaster", "w_chaingun", "w_glauncher", "w_hyperblaster", "w_machinegun", "w_railgun", "w_rlauncher", "w_shotgun", "w_sshotgun"]</code></li>
<li><code>ratamahatta.setWeaponName(weaponName)</code> set the weapon based on its name</li>
<li><code>ratamahatta.animationNames</code> is the names of available animation. It has 16 animations <code>["stand", "run", "attack", "pain", "jump", "flip", "salute", "taunt", "wave", "point", "crstand", "crwalk", "crattack", "crpain", "crdeath", "death"]</code></li>
<li><code>ratamahatta.setAnimationName(animationName)</code> set the animation based on its name</li>
</ul>


<h2>threex.md2charactercontrols.js</h2>

<p>First you create controls for your character like this</p>

<p><code>
var controls    = new THREEx.MD2CharacterControls(character.object3d)
</code></p>

<p>Dont forget to update it when you render with <code>controls.update(delta, now)</code>. The character is controlled by <code>controls.inputs</code> properties. You just have to set them to fit your need.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>control.inputs.right</code> is true if the character must go right</li>
<li><code>control.inputs.left</code> is true if the character must go left</li>
<li><code>control.inputs.up</code> is true if the character must go forward</li>
<li><code>control.inputs.down</code> is true if the character must go backward</li>
</ul>


<h2>threex.md2character.js</h2>

<p>It provide the base to play with the model.
It is a modified version of
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/MD2Character.js">MD2Character.js</a>
from this <a href="http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_morphtargets_md2.html">webgl_morphtargets_md2.html three.js example</a>.</p>

<p>First you create it.
<code>
var character   = new THREEx.MD2Character()
</code></p>

<p>Dont forget to update it at every frame with a <code>character.update(delta)</code></p>

<ul>
<li><code>character.object3d</code> is the THREE.Object3D container</li>
<li><code>character.setWireframe(boolean)</code> set the model in wireframe.</li>
<li><code>character.setWeapon(weaponIndex)</code> add a weapon in the character hand. <code>weaponIndex</code> is between 0 and 11. if -1, it removes the weapon.</li>
<li><code>character.setSkin(skinIndex)</code> set the skin of the character. <code>skinIndex</code> is between 0 and 4</li>
<li><code>character.setAnimation(animationName)</code> set the animation for the character. The name is one of <code>["stand", "run", "attack", "pain", "jump", "flip", "salute", "taunt", "wave", "point", "crstand", "crwalk", "crattack", "crpain", "crdeath", "death"]</code>.</li>
<li><code>character.setPlaybackRate(rate)</code> set the playback rate of the animation.</li>
<li><code>character.load(config)</code> loads the characters

<ul>
<li><code>character.addEventListener('loaded', function(){})</code> to be notified when the model is loaded</li>
<li><code>character.isLoaded()</code> is true if the model is loaded, false otherwise</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
