    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is our new edition of Three.js News. In this episode we will be amazed by cinematographic experiences and awesome effects. Some of them will even give you goosebumps or make your hairs stand on end. We will explore physics engines, blockbuster movies coming soon, particles, portfolios. We will take a look at everything from a manga universe to a world of change. There is also a show off, a very special mention to a great experience that we found, combining 3d animation, motion capture and projection. These vivid experiences are unforgettable and all too real.</p>

<h3>Cardboard With Oimo</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/cardboard_with_oimo.jpg" alt="cardboard_with_oimo" /></p>

<p>This is a very fun and colourful <a href="http://puga.com.br/play/cardboard-oimo/">demo</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/marciopuga">Marcio Puga</a> using oimo.js. <a href="http://lo-th.github.io/Oimo.js/">Oimo</a> is a great physics engine developed by lo-th. In this demo you can see how the spheres change color and react when they touch each other and the surface around them. It's very cool and you also have a view for google cardboard.</p>

<h3>Insidious movie experience</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/insidious_movie_experience.jpg" alt="insidious_movie_experience" /></p>

<p>This awesome cinematographic <a href="http://www.insidious-movie.net/entertheroom/">experience</a> will make your hairs stand on end. The first two episodes of the Insidious movie saga really frightened me. I'm anxiously waiting for the new one. This demo is not reassuring. I think i'm gonna be even more scared! You explore the room around you and click on the hot spots, the story will develop with each click. The effects will have you screaming your heart out!</p>

<h3>1 Million Particles</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/1million_particles.jpg" alt="1million_particles" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://codepen.io/edankwan/pen/QbMxWp">demo</a> shows us a beautiful and subtile way of creating particles in codepen.io. Developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/edankwan">Edan Kwan</a> using curl noise and fbo on three.js. He produced a very professional and fascinating effect. You can change the color of the particles, the size, the speed.</p>

<h3>Aaron Meyers portfolio</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/aaron_meyers_portfolio.jpg" alt="aaron_meyers_portfolio" /></p>

<p>In his <a href="http://aaron-meyers.com/!/">portfolio</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/aarontweets">Aaron Meyers</a> creates a very cool environment. We can see his skills as a developer in this original homepage.Turn around in the room and by clicking on each TV screen you can explore the works he has done. You can also click on Aaron himself to know a bit more about him. This is hands down one of the most creative portfolios I have seen.</p>

<h3>Realize project</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/realize_project.jpg" alt="realize_project" /></p>

<p>If you liked the movie Ghost in the Shell you are going to love this <a href="http://www.realize-project.jp/">project</a> It is an homage made by true fans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a> is a manga by Masamune Shirow, there was also a movie made of it. This demo captures the universe of the manga pretty well. You can turn around and decide which icon to pop-up. There are very cool neon lights in the space, it gives it kind of a Tron aspect. You can also take a look at posts on VR and AI from other news-based sites.</p>

<h3>A world of change</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/a_world_of_change.jpg" alt="a_world_of_change" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://news-lab-trends-experiment.appspot.com/">demo</a> is part of <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>. It is a great idea for social impact. Through google search you can click on topic (recycling, energy, water, natural environment, pollution) or a city, and see how those searches reflect the way the world thinks about climate change. You can discover what certain cities are doing about the environment. It is an eye opener and a great way to encourage sustainable development</p>

<h3>Terminator Genisys</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/terminator_genisys.jpg" alt="terminator_genisys" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.terminatorgenisysmovie.co.uk/insidelook/">Terminator Genisys</a> is another successful and  cinema based demo created my <a href="https://twitter.com/ParamountUK">Paramount Pictures</a>. You can get an amazing inside of the characters by rotating the camera to explore 3d models. You can also zoom in and click on hotspots for information and videos about the movie coming soon. It is very fun.</p>

<h3>Show Off "Le Petit Chef"</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/le_petit_chef.jpg" alt="le_petit_chef" /></p>

<p>Special mention to this great experience that we found. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBJEP4lsRFY&amp;feature=youtu.be">Le Petit Chef</a> is a masterpiece created by the guys at <a href="http://www.skullmapping.com/">Skull Mapping</a>, <a href="http://www.filipsterckx.be/">Filip Sterckx</a> and <a href="http://www.antoon.be/">Antoon Verbeek</a>. They experimented with projection on a dinner table. Combining 3d animation and motion capture, a miniature chef turns your dish into a grill and cooks right in front of your astonished eyes. I wish I could book a place at this table! It is an awesome experience that I'm sure you will love.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this episode of Three.js News we have seen awesome projects. All very vivid and lifelike. Some movie related and some really scary, others more realistic and down to protecting earth. They all have their own universe. We experienced physics and particles, projection and motion capture. Regardless of how or by whom they were developed, all these experiences show us what is possible to create in the amazing universe of 3D.</p>

<h3>Paranoid vs. Shy Birds</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/paranoid_vs_shy_birds.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p>This is a very fun <a href="http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/LVyJXw">demo</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/yakudoo">Yakudoo</a> on CodePen. The bird characters are so cute. The one in the middle is the paranoid one. You can move his head around and see how he interacts with the small shy birds. The HTML, CSS and Javascript are visible on the scene.</p>

<h3>Threepark</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/threepark.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p><a href="http://threepark.net/English">Threepark</a> is a cool editor developed by <a href="https://github.com/liguocn">liguocn</a>. Easy to understand and to use, great for artists and 3d lovers. You can create different models and designs. You even have a library of templates to use. Subdivide a model as many times as you like in the <a href="http://threepark.net/English/cagemodeling">cagemodeling</a> canvas. You can also store your models in the cloud and export them into 3d printing format. Great way to unleash your creativity.</p>

<h3>Parrot Hunt</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/parrot_hunt.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p>Very funky retro <a href="http://parrothunt.nergal.se:8080/">game</a>, and also a Chrome Experiment, created by  Magnus Persson aka <a href="https://twitter.com/lallassu">nergal</a> . The idea is to shoot only the parrots, not the flamingos. You can move around and reload your rifle to keep shooting at your prey. Fortunately its not real hunting! You can get really serious and try to improve your score every time like I did! It's really enjoyable and it makes you feel like a great aim.</p>

<h3>Ntype</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/ntype.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

It shows us a compelling and interesting way to explore 4D. The typography is extruded into the 4d dimension. You can change the parameters and settings and customise the rotation planes. You can even modify the trails that the letters leave behind them. There are also a lot of other designs to explore in Kevin's <a href="http://kevinzweerink.com/">homepage</a></p>

<h3>WikiGalaxy</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/wiki_galaxy.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.polyfra.me/#">WikiGalaxy</a> is a beautiful and original demo created by <a href="https://twitter.com/WikiGalaxy">Owen Cornec</a>. This experiment takes us to a fantastic space that we actually already use everyday life. We can visualise Wikipedia as a galactic web of information. It's a marvellous world of knowledge. There is a map where you can fly over the planets, zoom and search. Wikipedia articles are stars, interests are nebulas. Have a good time learning! You can see more WebGL visualisations  in Owen's <a href="http://www.polyfra.me/">portfolio</a></p>

<h3>Multivers3D</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/multivers3d.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p>This is the first <a href="https://multivers3d.fr/#/51184/Home.html">video game demo</a> released by the <a href="https://twitter.com/INF1N1T">multivers3d</a> team. It supports multi-users, cross platforms and it has zero install. This first episode is called Earth Creed. You are a honey bee and you need to harvest pollen and nectar from your environment. You have to use your judgement to equilibrate the balance of the ecosystem. This game will definitely make you love nature.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this post, we discovered some varied and original demos. We traveled through a space of information and explored 4D dimensions. We also played very funky games and designed 3D models with various subdivisions. The experience each of these demos give us is unique. Keep creating such wonderful projects.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Three.js News. See you next time.</p>

<h3>Enough</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/enough.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 43 35" /></p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/129003739">Enough</a> is an interactive picture book created by Isaac Cohen or <a href="https://twitter.com/cabbibo">Cabbibo</a>. It is a beautifully artistic and immersive adventure into a world of dreams. It makes the technology appear as if it were alive. It is wonderfully designed and it has a oneiric sense to it. In Cabbibo's <a href="http://cabbi.bo/">website</a> you can see all his other creations and be amazed by his skill.</p>

<h3>Experiment for Google IO 2015</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/experiment_google_io.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 46 03" /></p>

<p>This is a very fun and playful <a href="http://www.clicktorelease.com/code/io15/">demo</a> coded by <a href="https://twitter.com/thespite">Jaume Sanchez</a> for the latest Google IO. You play with the Is and the O by clicking on them. They react, with very good physics, by jumping around. There is also an option to change the camera and look at it from different angles.</p>

<h3>Pregoneros de Medellin</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/pregoneros_de_medellin.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 47 45" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pregonerosdemedellin.com/#en">Pregoneros de Medellin</a> is a breathtaking and very interactive street walk experience developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tibbb">Thibault Durand</a> and his talented team. It was created using a GoPro and Javascript. You can read the <a href="https://medium.com/@tibbb/how-we-created-an-immersive-street-walk-experience-with-a-gopro-and-javascript-f442cf8aa2dd">post</a> on how it was produced. In this web documentary you walk around Medellin city in Colombia and listen to the street-vendors cries, which are very traditional in the cultural Colombian landscape. You can click on each vendor to watch a video of his typical day to day life. I just loved it!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this blogpost we talked about some wonderful demos and very artistic projects. We were very impressed by the rich experiences that lead to web documentaries and interesting publications. All these demos are very interactive and show the amazing things we can do with 3D on the web.</p>

<p>We also want to thank our readers. We love it when developers out there send us their stuff, new and creative demos that we can share.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Three.js news. See you next time.</p>

<p>In this second edition of Three.js news we have collected very creative and funky demos. Some of them  were developed for both desktop and mobile phones. Some are games, some are just pure fun. Using the latest technologies, they are all a clear example of what's possible to do with web 3D today.</p>

<h2>Inconvergent Waves</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/inconvergent_waves.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 42 57" />
<a href="http://inconvergent.net/waves/">Inconvergent waves</a> is a nicely done demo by <a href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent">Anders Hoff</a>. You can create waves by moving your mouse around. It's like making ripples on the water. This technique is actually used as a method for generating landscapes. It's very reactive and the movements are smooth and natural. Visit the inconvergent <a href="http://inconvergent.net/">website</a> to check out the developing process.</p>

<h2>Interactive WebGL globes</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/interactive_webgl_globe.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 57 30" />
<a href="http://projects.delimited.io/webgl-globes/example_4_interactive_globe.html">Interactive WebGL</a> globes is a great way to improve your geography skills! This very educational and fun demo is a creation of <a href="https://twitter.com/delimitedtech">Steve Hall</a>. You mouseover the countries that you want and turn around by clicking on the interactive globe. Don't hesitate to read Steve's <a href="http://www.delimited.io/blog/2015/5/16/interactive-webgl-globes-with-threejs-and-d3">blogpost</a> to know more about his implementation of D3 and Three.js.</p>

<h2>Spiral Circle</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/spiral_circle.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 58 52" /></p>

<p><a href="http://projects.delimited.io/subunit/demos/spiral-circle-v2.html">Spiral Circle</a> is another cool demo created by Steve Hall. It is based on <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">mbostock’s</a> <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2472e84f78fd03df443f">example</a>. It is extremely hypnotic and it has kind of a disturbing texture, like the skin of a snake monster or something. You can pan to the left to divide the circle in two. Be careful, it's alive!</p>

<h2>Hatsune Miku</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/hatsune_miku_threejs.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 00 53" /></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku">Hatsune Miku</a> is a Three.js example <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_loader_mmd.html">demo</a> done by <a href="https://twitter.com/superhoge">takahiro</a>. It's a very fun demo even if takahiro is still working on improving it. This very cute blue hair girl is Japan's sweetheart. She dances in holograms and does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSyWtESoeOc">live concerts</a>...yeah i'm not kidding! We are even trying to bring her to life in <a href="https://twitter.com/LearningThreejs/status/600740523574439937">AR</a>.</p>

<h2>Race Against Oblivion</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/race_against_oblivion.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 59 58" /></p>

<p>Race against oblivion or <a href="http://www.timeshift165.com/game">Timeshift</a> is an  original game made by <a href="http://www.ultranoir.com/en/#!/home/">Utranoir</a>. Inspired on the story of a unique French car : The Delahaye 165, you have to race against time to save this one of a kind automobile. The presentation of the game is outstanding, it has great design, background and effects. Bonus, it can be played on both desktop and mobile!</p>

<h2>A Particle Dream</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/a_particle_dream.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 03 05" />
A Particle dream is a <a href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/particle-dream">demo</a> created by <a href="http://www.iamnop.com/">Nop Jiarathanakul</a>. It is one of the latest Chrome experiments. It is a wonderful simulation of particles moving smoothly around. You can choose the shape you want the particles to morph into. The music and the ambiance mix together for a very relaxing result. Oh and you can actually use <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> in this demo.</p>

<h2>Our Galactic Neighbourhood</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/our_galactic_neighborhood.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 02 06" /></p>

<p><a href="http://charliehoey.com/threejs-demos/our-galactic-neighborhood.html">Our Galactic Neighbourhood</a>
is another very educational demo. Developed by creative coder <a href="http://charliehoey.com/">Charlie Hoey</a> this demo is a simulation of the charted stars in our Galaxy. You are able to explore the stars travelling both in space and time. Have you ever wondered how the stars are like lightyears away from Earth? Or how will they be thousands of years from now? This demo is your interstellar adventure.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blogpost we reviewed some 3D demos for Three.js News. They are all very diverse. We saw games, educational projects, simulations and funky characters. What they all have in common is their creativity and the use of 3D technology on the web. Some even go further and incorporate fun control sensor like the Leap Motion device. Have fun checking out all these demos. I hope you enjoy them as much as we did.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Three.js News and see you next time.</p>
