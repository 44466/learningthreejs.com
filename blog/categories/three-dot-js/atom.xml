    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post introduces another episode of Three.js News. In this edition we explore dynamic and constantly changing experiences. With the featured demos we will travel through time, discover new worlds and parallel universes. We will also get into fun and procedurally generated experiences that never repeat themselves twice; they are different every time, no matter how much you try them out. We will enjoy psychedelic effects and interactive experiments.</p>

<h3>Ancient Earth</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-12-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-4-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/ancient_earth.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-11 at 14 45 41" /></p>

<p><a href="http://dinosaurpictures.org/ancient-earth/#0">Ancient Earth</a> is a very educational experiment found in the dinosaur pictures <a href="http://dinosaurpictures.org/">website</a>. It is a globe of how Earth used to look like, from 20 million to 600 million years ago. There is a list where you can choose any period on the evolution of our planet. For example, when multicellular life was first developed or when plants and flowers first appear... or even jump to dinosaur extinction! You can also remove clouds to see Earth's transformation and use the left and right keys to travel through time.</p>

<h3>Dennis</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-12-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-4-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/dennis.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-11 at 14 51 06" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dennis.video/">Dennis</a> is a very colourful generative 3D experience produced by <a href="http://aaf.nyc/">Always &amp; Forever</a> computer entertainment and presented by NHX. It is a fun music video with music from popcorn_10. Frames are created in real time. Nothing is pre-rendered. Each scene is procedurally created every time you press play. Youâ€™ll never see the same video twice. Check out the <a href="http://www.dennis.video/#about">about</a> page to see how it was developed.</p>

<h3>Growing Tree</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-12-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-4-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/growing_tree.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-11 at 15 05 00" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://gregtatum.com/poems/growth/#/1-seedling">demo</a> displays the beautiful and natural growth of a tree. It was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/TatumCreative">Greg Tatum</a>. You can check out his <a href="http://gregtatum.com/category/interactive/">blog</a> to see the other works and animations he has done. It starts out at the root, from seedling to tree with small incremental additions. It shows a dynamic growth of the 3D tree structure. Nice colours and lighting make it truly mesmerising.</p>

<h3>Another End Game</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-12-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-4-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/another_end_game.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-11 at 15 18 01" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.anotherend.com/">Another End</a> is a procedurally-generated game with an interesting story and a thread to follow. It was developed by Ryan Bottriell and his team. Inside the adventure, you are a player, created by Entity to reunite the 4 Glyphs which are essential to the world. You can have great powers; you can be Architect, a Protector, an Illusionist. Plus there are experimental versions to play it with Leap Motion and Occulus Rift. Follow them on <a href="https://twitter.com/anotherendgame">twitter</a> and take a look at all their developments.</p>

<h3>Simple Ball</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-12-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-4-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/simple_ball.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-11 at 15 29 21" /></p>

<p>In this second edition of Three.js news we have collected very creative and funky demos. Some of them  were developed for both desktop and mobile phones. Some are games, some are just pure fun. Using the latest technologies, they are all a clear example of what's possible to do with web 3D today.</p>

<h2>Inconvergent Waves</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/inconvergent_waves.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 42 57" />
<a href="http://inconvergent.net/waves/">Inconvergent waves</a> is a nicely done demo by <a href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent">Anders Hoff</a>. You can create waves by moving your mouse around. It's like making ripples on the water. This technique is actually used as a method for generating landscapes. It's very reactive and the movements are smooth and natural. Visit the inconvergent <a href="http://inconvergent.net/">website</a> to check out the developing process.</p>

<h2>Interactive WebGL globes</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/interactive_webgl_globe.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 57 30" />

<p><a href="http://projects.delimited.io/subunit/demos/spiral-circle-v2.html">Spiral Circle</a> is another cool demo created by Steve Hall. It is based on <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">mbostockâ€™s</a> <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2472e84f78fd03df443f">example</a>. It is extremely hypnotic and it has kind of a disturbing texture, like the skin of a snake monster or something. You can pan to the left to divide the circle in two. Be careful, it's alive!</p>

<h2>Hatsune Miku</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/hatsune_miku_threejs.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 00 53" /></p>

is another very educational demo. Developed by creative coder <a href="http://charliehoey.com/">Charlie Hoey</a> this demo is a simulation of the charted stars in our Galaxy. You are able to explore the stars travelling both in space and time. Have you ever wondered how the stars are like lightyears away from Earth? Or how will they be thousands of years from now? This demo is your interstellar adventure.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blogpost we reviewed some 3D demos for Three.js News. They are all very diverse. We saw games, educational projects, simulations and funky characters. What they all have in common is their creativity and the use of 3D technology on the web. Some even go further and incorporate fun control sensor like the Leap Motion device. Have fun checking out all these demos. I hope you enjoy them as much as we did.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Three.js News and see you next time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post shows how to read your phone camera and make it appears as
transparent, aka to act as a see-through.
It may seems unrelated to 3d at first but
it is extremely useful in augmented reality.
I know it may seem silly :)
But this see-throught is the base of Augmented Reality in a phone.
This and other AR tech will be the subject of future posts.</p>

<p>It makes your device 'appears as transparent'
So when the user is looking at her device, she is seeing the reality.
You just have to display your augmented part on top
and you got augmented reality. A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words :)</p>

<h2>How It Is Coded</h2>

<p>Webcams are great for interactivity.
  We will read the webcam thanks to <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>,
  html5 API which can be used to do video/audio conferences like  Skype or Hangout.</p>

<p>In our case, we just get the video from the webcam
  with the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html">getUserMedia() function</a>.
  we dont need all the network part.
  It is quite widespread according <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream">caniuse</a> which is great!
  You can learn more about it
  on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia">mdn</a>
  or <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/">html5rocks</a></p>

<p>Now that we know how to get a video, which camera to pick ?
This demo is intended for phone. They often got multiple cameras nowsadays.
  typically a front camera for selfies
  a back camera for the normal photos.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack">MediaStreamTrack</a> will list all the media source available in your browser.
  In webrtc vocabulary,
  front camera is called 'user' facing video
  back camera is a 'environment' facing .
  So we try to get the environment video camera if we can.</p>

<p>For the see-through effect to be convincing, we need to be careful.
  first we display the video stream in full screen, thus it
  is more real to the user.
  We display it in the background of the page with the proper css
Additionally we ensure we keep a proper
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29">aspect ratio</a>,
  no matter the size of the browser window.
  So it isn't streched.
So it must be robust to window resize and orientation change.
  All that makes the resize function more subtle than usual.
  but nothing dramatic</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>It's been nearly a month since I started publishing <a href="/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">"One threex a day" challenge</a>. The idea was to share with you the many <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extensions</a> that I had written over time. I wanted to show you how they could be useful, fun and easy to include in your very own three.js game. I came up with a motto "One threex a day gets your game on its way". I was all set up and ready to go. This was a challenge inspired by John Resig's article called <a href="http://ejohn.org/blo!/write-code-every-day/">"Write code everyday"</a>. I deeply agree with his theory for making progress, increasing productivity and getting the work done. I wished to try something similar on myself.</p>

<p>Let me tell you though... it WAS challenging! Keeping the publication rhythm was hard. It takes a lot of discipline and organization to get it done everyday. I had the best intentions, but unfortunately I got sick and I felt bad for most of last week. Additionally I had some day work on the side that I needed to get done. At this rate of publication, it was very hard to keep up! At first I wanted to publish the threex extensions for a period of two months but I think it is best to rest for a while. So a week ago I published the last three.js game extension of phase 1.</p>

<p>The good news is that I've had a very interesting experience. I'm pleased with the results. Obviously, some posts got more attention than others. I think this was because the three.js game extensions I published weren't all for hard-core developers or game creators. Some were pretty basic, but still had educational value for people just starting with three.js. I wanted them to be directed to all kinds of audience, amateurs and experts alike. I really appreciated the process of sharing these extensions, and overall I had a great response. I got some <a href="https://plus.google.com/104300307601542851567/posts/RhabZY19TSq">very</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/104300307601542851567/posts/RqDbZNeJEkW">cool</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/siggraph/status/464238273582211072">retweets</a> and a lot of positive echo from you guys. Thanks a lot! Don't hesitate to contact me and give me some more feedback.</p>

<p>I stopped publication last week, but wait...I'm not saying I'm giving up though. Far from it. I have promised myself, and I promise my readers, to come back with more three.js extensions. Especially, because I still have a lot to publish, there are still some tricks up my sleeve ;)  For the moment I will concentrate on regaining my strength, writing more code and documenting it for the next threex batch. I hope to deliver and publish it soon.</p>

<p>Stay tuned! I'll be back.</p>
