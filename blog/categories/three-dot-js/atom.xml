    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is another edition of Three.js News. We have collected some original demos with skilful effects and lots of style. There is a high degree of talent displayed on these projects. In this episode, we will cycle through the daring climbs of the Tour de France. We will turn around decadent blue worlds, play with colourful Rubik's cube and take the new Renault Espace for a test run. We will also merge and morph with creative experiences and investigate fascinating generative compositions.</p>

<h3>Metropolis</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/metropolis.jpg" alt="metropolis" /></p>

<p><a href="https://alexstockdale.com/metropolis/">Metropolis</a> is an impressive demo by <a href="https://twitter.com/ALIXPLOX">Alex Stockdale</a>. It is a spheric vision of an urban world in destruction, or construction, depending on how you see it. It has a decadent aspect to it, the light is like the shadow of a dream and there is a hazy bluish shade in the atmosphere. This project is not only interactive and skilful but it is also a great example of what we can do with three.js.</p>

<h3>The Climb of Alpe d'Huez</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/the_climb_alpe_huez.jpg" alt="the_climb_alpe_huez" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2015/jul/23/tour-de-france-the-climb-of-alpe-dhuez-interactive">demo</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/amason">Andrew Mason</a>, Troy Griggs and Lawrence Ostlere, is a 3D representation of the Tour de France. We cycle a trail following the iconic Alpe d'huez climb. Step by step we learn about its history, about details of the trickiest passings and challenges to get to the summit....wonderful work by the talented devs at the guardian!</p>

<h3>Roobix</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/roobix.jpg" alt="roobix" /></p>

<p><a href="http://playcanv.as/p/V9B7k46n">Roobix</a> is a very fun game created by <a href="https://twitter.com/marquizzo">Marco del Valle</a> on <a href="https://playcanvas.com/">Play Canvas</a>. It is a Rubik's cube simulator with great animations. The rotations and puzzle combinations are extremely fun to play with. The cube is very reactive and the twinkling colours are part of the features that make this game unique.</p>

<h3>Renault Espace</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/renault_espace.jpg" alt="renault_espace" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.littleworkshop.fr/renaultespace/">demo</a> is an interactive prototype of the New Renault Space by <a href="https://twitter.com/glecollinet">Guillaume Collinet</a>. It is a webgl visualizer using real time 3d. You can go inside the car as if you were gonna take it out for a test drive. The interior and animations are life-like and will make you feel like you own it! You can visit Guillaume's <a href="http://www.littleworkshop.fr/">little workshop</a> for more stylish experiences.</p>

<h3>Omm Experience</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/omm_experience.jpg" alt="omm_experience" /></p>

<p><a href="http://ommexperience.com/">Omm Experience</a> shows us the fantastic world created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jhelf">Jean Helfenstein</a>. At first, there is an awesome lens flare effect with a halo of light glowing around a revolving asteroid. As the demo evolves, there are 3 chapters about creativity with great morphing and merging animations that transform and deform the object as if it was a ball of water.</p>

<h3>Gridiron</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/gridiron.jpg" alt="gridiron" /></p>

<p><a href="http://haptic-data.com/project/gridiron">Gridiron</a> is "an exploration of generative compositions based on vertical structures fighting for space" developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hapticdata">Kyle Phillips</a>. We can see procedurally generated geometries that rain up and fill the screen. We can also modify their properties and play with the effects. It kind of reminds me of chemistry class.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this edition of Three.js News we saw the talent behind daring and challenging experiences like the Tour de France, behind life-like animations and reactive games like Rubik's cube. We floated through procedurally generated worlds and through spheric decadent visions of a city. We took a drive around our imagination and witnessed creativity in its abstract form.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing. Stay tuned for more Three.js News and see you next time.</p>

    <id>http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2015/07/30/three-dot-js-inspector-in-chrome-devtools</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>Recently people started to experiment with three.js and Chrome devtools. The excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/thespite">@thespite</a> first did <a href="https://github.com/spite/ShaderEditorExtension">Shader Editor Extension</a> and then <a href="https://twitter.com/thespite/status/624256879766712320">Three.js Editor Extension</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdoob">@mrdoob</a> did it too <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdoob/status/616042217464012800">here</a> where he links directly to the <a href="http://threejs.org/editor">three.js editor</a> itself. The goal is to make an extension which allows to inspect your page when you are debugging three.js.</p>

<p>All that is very early work, but the concept seems really promising. It will allow to interact with almost all three.js demos out there. It is a great tool to debug your own work, or to understand how a demo is done. You can even use it to fine tune your parameters.</p>

<p>I loved it so I decided to give it a shot. I forked @thespite work and looked at it over the last weekend. I reused the UI layer from the three.js editor, improved the UI a bit, and applied it to the Chrome Dev tools. The implementation still clearly has some quirks, but I love the concept. I believe it can be a very strong tool to debug three.js.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threejs-inspector/dnhjfclbfhcbcdfpjaeacomhbdfjbebi">Three.js Inspector Extension</a> on chrome app store and play with it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about the 10th episode of Three.js News. We are very happy to share exceptional demos with you every week. In all the 3D experiences we have shared on previous episodes, we have witnessed talent, dedication and skill. Without so many creative projects we wouldn't have been able to continue with the news. So, to celebrate this 10th edition, we are going to travel through space, time and even dimensions.</p>

<p>In this episode, we will explore other worlds and make musical journeys across decades and light years. We will wonder around the Parisian metro in a different light and be amazed by the simple beauty of land and stone. We will interact with the futuristic and be repelled by the terrestrial. We will learn to safeguard and preserve our cultural heritage through online 3D, and finally, take a walk through the magical woods of the imagination.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This demo shows Hatsune Miku dancing in augmented reality within
your browser! This is great and surprisingly easy to do.
All that running on your browser, based on web standards.
I did it to show it was possible to do AR within the browser. I wanted to share the code to see what you guys can do with it.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-07-16-hatsune-miku-dancing-in-augmented-reality/screenshots/screenshot-nexus9.png" width="350"></p>

<p>Best of all, it even runs on mobile phones that
support WebGL and WebRTC.
The screenshot on the right is made on a nexus.
So we can do augmented reality within the browser on mobile</p>

<h2>How is it coded ?</h2>

<p>It is mainly a link of 2 parts.
First <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.webar">webar extensions</a>
for three.js. They bundle what is needed to handle augmented reality with three.js, from the webcam setup to the marker localisation.
Second part is the <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_loader_mmd">mmd loader</a> which loads the model. It loads the Hatsune Miku model and its animations.</p>

<p>Once you got those 2 parts, things are simple :) you just have to display your model where your marker is.
To know the tech details, you will have to dig in <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_loader_mmd">the</a>
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.webar">code</a>.
I will likely talk more about AR tho.</p>

<h2>Now Let's Do a Bit of History</h2>

<p>I did this to show it was possible to do AR within the browser and to share the code to see what you guys can do with it.
It was for a <a href="http://daqri.com/dublinhacks/">AR oriented hackathon</a> in Dublin.
It recently landed a <a href="https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/572435641079877632">new job</a> at <a href="http://daqri.com">Daqri</a>. Part of my job is developer relations, so I get to help people doing AR. I love it :)</p>

<p>All the code to handle Hatsune Miku is from
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/takahiro-aoyagi/96/10a/41a">Takahiro Aoyagi</a>.
He did a <a href="http://github.io/takahirox/three.js">fork on three.js</a> to load mmd formats, the format used to store Hatsune Miku.
It may be included in three.js soon.
Here is his <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_loader_mmd">example for three.js</a>
It all started with his <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/mmd-viewer-js/">mmd viewer</a> in pure webgl.
The original contains a LOT of neat features like inverse kinetic, physics for the hair,
a toon shader to make the color more cartoonish, a edge shader to enhance the outline of the model
like a drawing.
He is doing excellent work. Check him out on twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/superhoge">@superhoge</a>.</p>

<p>Let's have a word about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku">Hatsune Miku</a> herself.
It is such a nice story.
She is a Japanese star but she is purely virtual.
She is a humanoid persona which appears as a drawing or as a hologram.
There is no human behind, even for the voice!
When she sings, what you hear is a voice synthesizer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypton_Future_Media">crypton</a>
All that is crazy but true :)</p>

<p>She even does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEaBqiLeCu0">concerts</a> where thousand of fans are go to see her.
Actual human fans I mean, not virtual ones.
As you can see, Hatsune Miku is no stranger to augmented reality.
I love her!</p>

<h2>How To Run The Demo ?</h2>

<p>You may want to run this demo obviously.
Here is how to do it.
First you put the <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/demo.hatsunemiku-augmentedreality">demo url</a> in your browser.
It will read your webcam using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia">getUserMedia</a>. When it asks for permission, allow it :)
Then you need to put this <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/demo.hatsunemiku-augmentedreality/marker/image-marker-265.html">AR marker</a> in front of the camera.
You can print it and point the camera toward the paper
or you can load the marker web page and put the phone in front of the camera.
And now you can see Hatsune Mike Dancing in Augmented Reality.</p>

<p>Now let's look at it in action in this little screencast.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you want to experiment with augmented reality and three.js, checkout <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.webar">threex.webar</a>.
It is so cool to make augmented reality on the web!
I hope you have as much fun as I had doing it :)
I can't wait to see what augmented reality will do on mobile's browsers.</p>

<p>That's all folks. Have fun.</p>
