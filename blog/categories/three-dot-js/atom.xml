    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wouldn't that be cool if we were able to mix normal web pages in our webgl? To interact with them as we usually do? to view them,  to click on them... To scroll, to hover or even to type in input tags.
Oh yeah it would be so great! We, webgl people, are currently an isolated Island in the web world.  Being able to mix with normal page would give us access to so much interactive content.
In this post,  we gonna see how to do exactly this: how to seamlessly mix normal DOM elements in our webgl scene.  They will actually  appear as part of the 3d scene. Don't worry it is surprisingly easy with three.js.</p>

<h2>Demo of a youtube browser mixed in WebGL</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/data/2013-04-30-closing-the-gap-between-html-and-webgl/screenshots/navigation-bar-small.png"></p>

<p>First let's see the result in action. Here is a demo I did to show all the videos I have done for this blog.
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/videobrowser4learningthreejs">Try it out</a>!
It shows a 3d scene with a tv set and three characters sitting on grass.</p>

<p><a href='http://jeromeetienne.github.io/videobrowser4learningthreejs/' target='_blank'><input type="button" value='Try Learningthree.js video browser!' style='font-size:200%' /></a>
<a href='http://learningthreejs.com/data/2013-04-30-closing-the-gap-between-html-and-webgl/index.html' target='_blank'><input type="button" value='Try Demo!' style='font-size:200%' /></a></p>

<p>The key point is on the tvset screen. This is an actual YouTube player. Not me emulating it, this is the real thing! You can access it anytime from the blog navigation bar as
you can see on the right.
This
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/videobrowser4learningthreejs">demo</a>
is pretty cool no? Now let's see how to do this.</p>

<h2>Let's Get Started</h2>

<p>DOM elements are all about flat 2d rectangles. In
<a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a>
, such a thing is called a
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/extras/geometries/PlaneGeometry.js">THREE.PlaneGeometry</a>.
So let's try to map a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM/element">dom element</a>
to a
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/extras/geometries/PlaneGeometry.js">THREE.PlaneGeometry</a>.
Their position and rotation must match.
The goal is to make them appear as one thus the viewer can't distinguish them.</p>

<p>So first, how to orientate a dom element, would you ask?
Simple we gonna use a feature introduced by HTML5, called
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/">css 3D transformation</a>.
Here are some <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/3d/css/">tutorials</a>
<a href="http://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/">about</a>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Tutorials/Using_CSS_transforms">it</a>.
css3d is done for this exact purpose, to position and rotate a DOM element in 3d.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/data/2013-04-30-closing-the-gap-between-html-and-webgl/screenshots/grid-only-small.png"></p>

<p>Good News! three.js can already render things using this technology.
 It is called <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/renderers/CSS3DRenderer.js">THREE.CSS3DRenderer</a>.
See <a href="http://threejs.org/examples/css3d_molecules.html">various</a>
<a href="http://threejs.org/examples/css3d_periodictable.html">examples</a>
of
<a href="http://threejs.org/examples/css3d_youtube.html">its</a>
<a href="http://threejs.org/examples/css3d_panorama.html">usage</a>
in three.js <code>/examples</code>.
Now we need to put the same plane on both renderers, WebGL Renderer and CSS3D Renderer.
Here is the code for the plane in
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/renderers/WebGLRenderer.js">WebGLRenderer</a>
, wireframe with segments to see thru.</p>

<p><code>javascript
// create the plane mesh
var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ wireframe: true });
var geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry();
var planeMesh= new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
// add it to the WebGL scene
glScene.add(planeMesh);
</code></p>

<p>Now that we got the plane in place, here is the code for the DOM element in css 3d.
Notice how we reference the same position and rotation as the <code>planeMesh</code>, thus
they will move together.</p>

<p><code>javascript
// create the dom Element
var element = document.createElement( 'img' );
element.src = 'textures/sprites/ball.png';
// create the object3d for this element
var cssObject = new THREE.CSS3DObject( element );
// we reference the same position and rotation
cssObject.position = planeMesh.position;
cssObject.rotation = planeMesh.rotation;
// add it to the css scene
cssScene.add(cssObject);
</code></p>

<p><img class="right" src="/data/2013-04-30-closing-the-gap-between-html-and-webgl/screenshots/grid-css-small.png"></p>

<p>All seems to go well.
We got the same plane in css and webgl. Now we need to see the dom element behind the webgl plane.
To do this, let's use webgl renderer and css3d renderer together on the same page.</p>

<p>We use stylesheet to put css renderer exactly behind the webgl one.
Thus they look the same to the viewer, as you can see on the right.
Use the following line to obtain the same result.</p>

<p><code>javascript
var cssRenderer = new THREE.CSS3DRenderer();
cssRenderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
cssRenderer.domElement.style.position = 'absolute';
cssRenderer.domElement.style.top = 0;
</code></p>

<p><img class="right" src="/data/2013-04-30-closing-the-gap-between-html-and-webgl/screenshots/object-inmiddle-small.png">
<img class="left" src="/data/2013-04-30-closing-the-gap-between-html-and-webgl/screenshots/object-infront-small.png"></p>

<p>We are in good shape but not yet done. We still need to make both react as if they were one.
What happens if we add a torus 3d object in front of webgl plane? As you can see on the
left, it looks Ok.
What if we put this object behind it? Hmm not so good. As you can see on the right, the object
is behind the Plane,
but it is in front of the dom element. It should appear as if the torus were behind but it doesn't.
Why's that? It is due to the webgl
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">z-buffer</a>.</p>

<p>It displays our torus because it thinks the torus is closer to the camera than the DOM element.
It's not aware that our webgl plane should act as a see-thru to make our css3d visible.
So nothing behind our webgl plane should be displayed.
How to fix this, you would ask? We're gonna use a tricky part of webgl: the blending.</p>

<h2>Blending them together</h2>

<p>What is blending ? It is the way to determine the color of a pixel when you add a
new pixel (fragment in technical terms).
So when doing blending, we use a blend function to combine the colors from both the
existing and the new fragments to make an entirely new fragment.</p>

<p>It is a weird beast using several WebGL calls and many equations. The total number of possibilities is scary :)
A complete explanation of blending is way out of scope of this post. For more detail, see
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/WebGL-Beginners-Guide-Diego-Cantor/dp/184969172X">"WebGL Beginner's Guide"</a>
from
<a href="http://blog.tojicode.com/">Brandon Jones</a>, a great book to start with raw WebGL.
To get a feel of blending,  you can play with them in
<a href="http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_materials_blending_custom.html">this example</a>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/data/2013-04-30-closing-the-gap-between-html-and-webgl/screenshots/object-behind-small.png"></p>

<p>The one which interest us is called <code>THREE.NoBlending</code>.
When drawing the face, it will completely ignore the color below and set it to the color of the face.
So if we put our face color to black aka <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> and opacity to <code>0</code>, we gonna obtained what we want.
The plane will act as a see-thru to the dom element below. Here is how you initialize your material.</p>

<p><code>javascript
var material    = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial();
material.color.set('black')
material.opacity    = 0;
material.blending   = THREE.NoBlending;
// any mesh using this material will act as a see-thru to the css renderer
</code></p>

<p>Then we are done ! We got a actual dom element seamlessly integrated in our webgl scene!  Let's pet our back,  i think this is an important step!</p>

<h2>HTML And WebGL Sitting Together In A Tree ?</h2>

<p>Well, not quite unfortunatly...
WebGL is 3d inside a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">canvas element</a>
and a canvas is a black box from the html page point of view.
You can't bind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events">DOM events</a> inside canvas.
You can't have
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development)">stylesheet</a>
to change canvas content.
You can't put dom elements inside your canvas.
Those two don't talk to each other.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly it isn't all pink, WebGL and HTML aren't really merged.
This is only a nice trick. It has some limitations.
For example, the dom element is rotated using <a href="http://example.com/TODO">css 3d</a>.
This is a fairly new technology.
So you may hit bugs.</p>

<p>Moreover, it only appears as a part of 3d... but this remains plain DOM.
So it doesn't benefit from webgl specific display.
For example, it is impossible to get
<a href="http://example.com/TODO">post processing</a>
on the dom element.
Indeed, this technic is applied in 2d on the rendered scene and the DOM element is not in it.
Additionally the dom element won't share the lighting as the rest of your webgl scene.
Nevertheless, <a href="http://example.com/TODO">css shader</a> allows you to apply shader on normal DOM element,
so it may be possible to make a coherent lighting.
The web is so beautiful nowadays!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Congratulations guys! You can now mix html pages with your webgl content. You have learned how to close the gap between HTML and WebGL. It is a new way to experience and to interact with webgl 3d.</p>

<p>I love this new trick.
I've been trying to make webgl easier for while now.
My strategy has been to make it closer to what webdevs know today,
copying <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery/">jQuery API on top of three.js</a>,
emulating <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/01/17/dom-events-in-3d-space/">dom events inside webgl scene</a>
or even making <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/02/27/linkify-tquery-extension/">3d text act as web links</a>.
To integrate actual web pages inside webgl scene definitly matches this vibe!</p>

<p>That's all for today, have fun :)</p>

    <updated>2013-04-05T09:15:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2013/04/05/debugging-with-chromes-canvas-inspection</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post will present to you how to debug your webgl with  chrome's canvas inspection.
This is an experimental feature available in chrome devtools.
It gives you all the WebGL calls which are done in your webgl scene.
So it helps if you actually know some raw WebGL :)
In anycase you can see it being replayed call by calls, which is uber cool.</p>

</center>

<h2>Let's get started</h2>

<p>As it is an experimental feature, you first need to enable it.
First let's enable devtool experiment: enter "chrome://flags" url
in your chrome location bar. There you enable "Enable Developer Tools experiments"
and relaunch chrome.</p>

<p><img src="/data/2013-04-05-debugging-with-chromes-canvas-inspection/screenshots/devtools-enable-experiments.png"></p>

<p><img class="right" src="/data/2013-04-05-debugging-with-chromes-canvas-inspection/screenshots/devtools-settings-gear.png" width="160" height="120"></p>

<p>Now that you got the Developer Tools Experiments enabled, let's enable
'Canvas Inpection' in particular. Click on the little gear on bottom right
of devtools. The one you can see on the right.</p>

<p><img src="/data/2013-04-05-debugging-with-chromes-canvas-inspection/screenshots/devtools-settings-panel.png"></p>

<p>It will open the settings panel you see above.
Now, select experiment from the left menu, enable 'Canvas Inpection' and you are done.
Rather clumsy but this is an experiment after all :)</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<p>Now that it is enabled, let's see how to use it.
First let's go on the "profile" tab of devtools. We can see "Capture Canvas Frame", this is the one we gonna use.</p>

<p><img src="/data/2013-04-05-debugging-with-chromes-canvas-inspection/screenshots/devtools-capture-canvas-frame.png"></p>

<p>Let's enable it and load a page with WebGL.
As an example, i will use <a href="http://mmo3d.jit.su/montains">mmo3d</a>. It is a multiplayer game
in webgl. It is very hackable so other people can easily do their own world. Let's talk about
that later. For now, lets click 'start' and capture a frame :)</p>

<h2>Captured frames</h2>

<p>After that you should obtain the following. You got the actual game on the left.
and you recognise developer tools on the right.</p>

<p><img src="/data/2013-04-05-debugging-with-chromes-canvas-inspection/screenshots/devtools-capture-example-resized.png"></p>

<p>For every frame you capture, you will get a trace log of each webgl call which has been done during this frame.
Above there is a replay window where you can actually see the scene as it is drawn step by step.
Thus you can check the order of your calls. It can be usefull when you debug transparency for example.
Watch for the draw calls, they got huge overhead and should be limited if possible.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As it is pure webgl, and not at three.js level, it helps if you know raw WebGL. For that, i suggest
you to read a book on the subject. Personnaly i
like
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/WebGL-Beginners-Guide-Diego-Cantor/dp/184969172X">"WebGL Beginner's Guide"</a>
by
<a href="http://blog.tojicode.com/">Brandon Jones</a>.
WebGL may be complex at times, and having cool debug tools help being more efficient.
You can see the excelent paul irish doing a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY5iiuQRyEE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8m23s">presentation</a>
what you can do with canvas inspector.</p>

<p>That's all folks. Have Fun!</p>

<h2>WebRTC is great!</h2>

<p>WebRTC starts to get traction. I love that! We have seen
<a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>
and
<a href="http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html">getUserMedia</a>
several times in the past: in
<a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/05/15/punch-a-doom-character-in-augmented-reality/">"Punch a Doom Character in Augmented Reality"</a>
post, in
<a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/02/07/live-video-in-webgl/">"Fun With Live Video in WebGL"</a>
post and
<a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/05/02/augmented-reality-3d-pong/">"Augmented Reality 3D Pong"</a>
post.
It is
<a href="http://www.webrtc.org/blog/seeyouontheweb">already in chrome stable</a>
, and will be in firefox
<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/11/progress-update-on-webrtc-for-firefox-on-desktop/">real soon</a>.
They already
<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/hello-chrome-its-firefox-calling/">talk to each other</a>.
Here we don't need the network part of webrtc.
We only need get the webcam video, so
<a href="http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html">getUserMedia</a>
is enougth. It is in
<a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">opera 12</a>
too as you can read
<a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/head-tracking-with-webrtc/">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/auduno">auduno</a> is part of
<a href="http://opera.com">Opera</a> team.
He wrote it as a demo for
<a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">opera 12</a>
release  which contained
<a href="http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html">getUserMedia</a>.
For more info on the library, <a href="https://github.com/auduno">auduno</a>
blogged
about internals of
<a href="https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr">his library</a>. You can find details in his
<a href="http://auduno.tumblr.com/post/25125149521/head-tracking-with-webrtc">blog post</a>.
Additionnal info are available in the
<a href="http://auduno.github.com/headtrackr/documentation/reference.html">reference documentation</a>.
Some examples are already in three.js, like
<a href="http://auduno.github.com/headtrackr/examples/targets.html">targets</a>
or
<a href="http://www.shinydemos.com/facekat/">facekat</a>.</p>

<h2>Demo Time !!</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/data/2013-03-12-playing-with-headtrackr-dot-js/screenshots/screenshot-box3d-small.png">
As usual we did a plugin for
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery">tQuery API</a>
to make it easy to use in our environement.
One can find 2 examples for it:
A <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery/plugins/headtrackr/examples/index.html">educational example</a>
where your heads controls a box in 3d.
For best result, <em>make sure your face is well and evenly lighted</em></p>

<p><img class="right" src="/data/2013-03-12-playing-with-headtrackr-dot-js/screenshots/screenshot-demo-small.png">
Another <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery/plugins/headtrackr/examples/demo.html">demo</a>
where the camera follows your head.
The whole scene moves as you move your head, providing quite an immersive experience.
You can play with it <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jetienne/tSQQ8/">thru jsfiddle</a> too.</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/jetienne/tSQQ8/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<h2>Let's Get Started</h2>

<p>Ok now lets see how to use this library with
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery">tQuery API</a>.
First, we include the <code>tquery.headtrackr</code> files in your code.
tQuery plugins supports
<a href="http://requirejs.com">require.js</a>.
It makes dependancies much easier to handle. <code>tquery.headtrackr</code> is no exception, so to include it you can do</p>

<p>```javascript
require(['tquery.headtrackr'], function(){</p>

<pre><code>// Your code ...    
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>Or if you use the good old <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, do something like that
to include
<a href="https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr">headtrackr.js</a> itself, the library which handle the head tracking. Then you just include the plugin itself, and you are done.</p>

<p>```html</p>

<script src="headtrackr.js"></script>


<script src="tquery.headtrackr.js"></script>


<p>```</p>

<h3>Start Tracking Heads</h3>

<p>First, you instanciate the object with this simple line.
You can pass various options to <code>.createHeadtrackr(opts)</code>.
Here, <code>opts</code> is an
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object">Object</a>
with those properties</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>opts.width :</strong> width of the image containing the face. default to 320px</li>
<li><strong>opts.height :</strong> height of the image containing the face. default to 240px</li>
<li><strong>opts.headtrackrOpts :</strong> options passed directly to headtrackr.js. default to <code>{}</code></li>
</ul>


<p><code>javascript
var headTracker = tQuery.createHeadtrackr();
</code></p>

<p>Default are reasonable, so chances are you dont need to specify anything. To start tracking the head on the webcam, just do the following</p>

<p><code>javascript
headTracker.start();
</code></p>

<p>It is possible to stop it with <code>.stop()</code> or to reset it via <code>.reset()</code>.</p>

<h3>Debug View is Cool For User Feedback</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/data/2013-03-12-playing-with-headtrackr-dot-js/screenshots/screenshot-debugview-small.png">
If you wish enable the debugView, aka the little visualisation the headtracker result.
It gives feedback to the user on what is happening.
Thus the user can move his head accordingly or to change lighting of the room.</p>

<p><code>
headTracker.debugView(true);
</code></p>

<h3>Face Position Notified thru Events</h3>

<p>When a face is found, events are dispatched to notify the detected positions.</p>

<p>```
headTracker.addEventListener("found", function(event){</p>

<pre><code>// Your code ...
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p><code>event</code> contains normalized coordinates of the detected face.
They use the same axis as WebGL.
If the head is on the center, <code>event.x</code> and <code>event.y</code> will be 0.
And if the head is vertical, <code>event.angle</code> is 0. More precisely</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.x</code> and <code>.y</code> : It is the center position. it varies from [-1,+1], from left to right
and bottom to top.</li>
<li><code>.width</code> and <code>.height</code>: the width and height :) If it is half of whole image, it is equal to 1.</li>
<li><code>.angle</code>: the Z rotation of the detected head. It is in radian as usual.</li>
<li><code>.headtrackrEvent</code>: the original facetrackingEvent event from
<a href="https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr">headtrackr.js</a>
(see
<a href="http://auduno.github.com/headtrackr/documentation/reference.html">reference</a>
)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Head tracking... Kesaco ?</h2>

<p>Head tracking is a <a href="http://example.com">well known concept</a>. One can find
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBQQEcfkHoE">head tracking on ipad</a>.
One can find <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw">head tracking on wii</a>.
They got impressive result using the informations from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote">wiimote</a> or even the <a href="http://example.com">device orientation</a>.
With the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect">kinect</a>, they even
track the <a href="http://example.com">features</a> of the face itself (e.g. mouth, noze, eyes etc...)</p>

<p>In our case, we use the image from the webcam.
Unfortunatly face localisation from an image isn't exactly 100% accurate to say the least :)
See <a href="http://auduno.github.com/headtrackr/examples/targets.html">here</a>,
this is the same demo as the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw">wii one</a>
or the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBQQEcfkHoE">ipad one</a>.
Yet the result isn't as convincing.
With <a href="https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr">headtrackr.js</a> and
<a href="http://webrtc.org">webrtc</a>
, we use only the webcam in a uncontrolled environement.
So the accuracy is in consequences.</p>

<p>You can improve efficiency by following a few simples advices:
Avoid hats or a too crazy haircut. Being bold with a beard doesn't help :)
Make sure your face is well and evenly lighted and you should be fine.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post, we have seen it is now possible to do head tracking in a web browser !!
Impressive if you ask me!
Even better, it is easy if you use suitable libraries. Coupled with
<a href="http://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>
and
<a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery">tQuery API</a>,
it is possible provide new immersive experience in
<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jetienne/tSQQ8/">20lines of javascript</a>.
Im so excited.
This kind of things was academic research 5 years ago, and now everybody can easily use it.
We will likely do more with
<a href="https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr">headtrackr.js</a>.
This is a very nice library with lots of possibilities.
For example, one can use it the head as a game controller, or in a artistic exposition. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>That's all folks, have fun :)</p>

    <id>http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/07/05/minecraft-character-in-webgl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about Minecraft Character.
We will play with the minecraft character, learn how to do your own and make it move.
I recently saw this excelent <a href="http://djazz.mine.nu/lab/minecraft_items/">minecraft items demo</a>
by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/daniel_hede">@daniel_hede</a>. It triggered a switch in my head :)
I felt in love with minecraft style of 3d.
It makes modeling so simple.
You don't need to learn how to use 3d modeling software like
<a href="http://www.blender.org/">blender</a>,
<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/maya/">maya</a> and such.
It is easy to create new model based on this style.</p>

<p>Try the <a href="/data/2012-07-05-minecraft-character-in-webgl/">minecraft plugin demo</a>. This is the
one we gonna build. I used <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/daniel_hede">@daniel_hede</a>'s code
and did many plugins to make it all simple and fun :)
In this demo, i introduce
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/js/postprocessing">three.js post processing</a>
for the first time.
This is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting">Vignetting</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepia_(color)">sepia color</a>
that you see.
Additionnaly, you can easily change the skins with the UI within the demo.
Now let's get started!</p>

<h2>Let's start coding</h2>

<p>We start to create our world as usual. This initialize the renderer, the camera,
its controls and a rendering loop.
We setup the
<a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/01/19/boilerplate-builder-for-three-js/">boilerplate for three.js</a>
and add a page title with some info on our little 3D demo.
We just put the camera a little closer to scene center. Thus the character
will be bigger on screen. We just can't get enougth of it, can we ;)</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>var world   = tQuery.createWorld().boilerplate().pageTitle('#info').start();
world.tCamera().position.z  = 1.8;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now we add a bit of post processing. It is the first time
we talk about this, so let's details it a bit.
What is post processing (in a 3d context) ?
Post processing is performed after rendering the 3D, hence the name.
It applies on the screen as a whole. So the effects are in 2D.
What's it not ?
It isn't for 3d effect on specific objects in your world.</p>

<p> <code>tquery.effectcomposer.js</code> plugin provides a simple api to add
postprocessing to our world. It is a chained API on top of
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/js/postprocessing">three.js effect composer</a>.
In our case, we first apply <code>.sepia()</code> to change the colors toward
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepia_(color)">sepia color</a>.
Then we apply <code>.vignette()</code> for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting">Vignetting</a>
and mark the effects list
as finished.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>world.addEffectComposer().sepia().vignette().finish();
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Not too hard hey ;)</p>

<h2>Hello Steve!</h2>

<p>Now that we go a world. We will create a minecraft character.
In fact, minecraft main character is called <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/The_Player">'steve'</a>.
 <code>tQuery.MinecraftChar</code> is the main class. It will create
a character model and expose all its limbs too e.g right legs or right arms.
More on that later.
As you can see, we specify <code>skinUrl</code> parameter. It should point to the
image of the skin texture. You can change it anytime with <code>character.loadSkin(skinUrl)</code></p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>var character   = new tQuery.MinecraftChar({
    skinUrl : 'images/3djesus.png'
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now that we got our character setup, we just need to include it in our 3D world.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>character.model.addTo(world);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Make this model move</h2>

<p>So we talked about exposed limbs... kinda gross, almost disturbing :)
In fact it just means each part of our model is exposed for you to
play with. It has the head, legs right and left, and the same for the arms.
It is all in <code>character.parts</code>.</p>

<p>So the first step is to hook a function in the world rendering loop.
two parameters are passed <code>delta</code> and <code>now</code>. <code>delta</code> is the number
of seconds since the last iteration of the rendering loop. <code>now</code> is the absolute
time in seconds.
We use those values to tune the animation. Thus it will be animated at the same
speed no matter the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate">fps</a> rate of your computer.
Here is simple animation of the head. So we hook the function and change
the <code>headGroup</code> rotation to fit our taste.
We will make it do an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_(number)">eight</a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#Infinity_symbol">infinite synbol</a></p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>world.loop().hook(function(delta, now){
    character.parts.headGroup.rotation.x    = Math.sin(now*1.5)/3;
    character.parts.headGroup.rotation.y    = Math.sin(now)/3;
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is nice but the body would appear rather static if we move only the head.
Let's make see how to make it walk.
When people walks or run, they swing theirs arm and legs.
So we need to change the rotation X of each of those limbs. First we get
an angle relative to current time. It will determine the position of the arms/legs.
The amplitude of the move has been tuned to <code>1.4</code>, play with it and find the
value you like. Then you move the legs and arms by setting the rotation.
Just take care of balancing legs and arms thus his can keep his balance :)</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>world.loop().hook(function(delta, now){
    var angle   = 1/2 * now*Math.PI*2;
    // move the arms
    character.parts.armR.rotation.x = 1.4 * Math.cos(angle + Math.PI);
    character.parts.armL.rotation.x = 1.4 * Math.cos(angle);
    // move the legs
    character.parts.legR.rotation.x = 1.4 * Math.cos(angle);
    character.parts.legL.rotation.x = 1.4 * Math.cos(angle + Math.PI);
});
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>And we are done! Pretty cool no ? :)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>So we did a little character ala minecraft.
We got a basic animations of it. Nevertheless it would be neat to make animations
more robusts and generic. A new post will likely focus on this.
I so love this field and how it make things easier.</p>

<p>That's all folks. Have fun :)</p>

This one is about
<a href="https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs">physijs</a>
by
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chandlerprall">Chandler Prall</a>.
It easily bind
<a href="https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/">ammo.js</a>
and
<a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/">three.js</a>.
We will walk thru an example using it.
Physics is always important in 3D graphics.
It makes scenes more realistic.
Additionally, if you simple put your object into the scene, it will move nicely and realisticly.
So you spend less time tuning each moves. I am quite lazy so it matters :)

<h2>What About Physics Engines ?</h2>

<p>We already did physics with three.js.
It was with <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/microphysics.js">microphysics.js</a> for <a href="http://marblesoccer.com">marblesoccer</a> minigame.
It is a micro library implementing 3D physics.
We talked quite a bit about it in
<a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/10/17/lets-make-a-3d-game-microphysics-js/">"Lets Make a 3D Game: microphysics.js"</a>
and
<a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/11/02/lets-make-a-3d-game-helper-for-microphysics-js/">"Lets Make a 3D Game: microphysics.js, Even Easier"</a>.
It is only 500lines!
Unfortunatly, this tiny size comes limitations.</p>

<p>Today we gonna use <a href="https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs">physijs</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chandlerprall">Chandler Prall</a>.
This is a nice library which make it easy to use
<a href="https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/">ammo.js</a>
with
<a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/">three.js</a>.
ammo.js is "Direct port of the Bullet physics engine to JavaScript using
<a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">Emscripten</a>.
The source code is translated directly to JavaScript, without human rewriting, so functionality should be identical to the original Bullet."</p>

<p><a href="http://bulletphysics.org/">bullet</a> is a full-blown physics engine well-known in the 3D community.
It can do a lot as you can see in its <a href="http://bulletphysics.com/Bullet/BulletFull/">docs</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/">ammo.js</a>
supports all the features you can expect from a mature 3D physics engine.
Charles J. Cliffe, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ccliffe">@ccliffe</a>,
did several demos using ammo.js.
This one is a <a href="http://cjcliffe.github.com/CubicVR.js/cubicvr/samples/physics/physics_heightfield.html">heighfield</a>
And look at this <a href="http://cjcliffe.github.com/CubicVR.js/cubicvr/samples/vehicle_physics_demo/stunt_track1.html">stunt track</a>!
Both are on top of <a href="http://www.cubicvr.org/">cubicvr</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ccliffe">@ccliffe</a> own library.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs">physijs</a> has been written with performance in mind.
<a href="https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/">ammo.js</a> is running in a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_web_workers">webworker</a>.
So it most likely run on a second CPU. This is twice more cpu power for your javascript!
Coordinates are exchanged with
<a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/12/Transferable-Objects-Lightning-Fast">transferable objects</a>
when available.
Transferable objects is a special type of object which can be transfered between the main thread and the worker <strong>without copying</strong>
the data. Thus no matter how large the data are, it will be very low latency.</p>

<h2>Lets Get Started</h2>

<p>The code of today is a copy of the
<a href="http://chandlerprall.github.com/Physijs/examples/collisions.html">collision example</a>
from
<a href="http://chandlerprall.github.com/Physijs/">physijs</a>
using it thru tQuery API.
It may usefull to reimplement the same thing, just to be sure they both perform the same way. :)
<a href="/data/2012-06-05-3d-physics-with-three-js-and-physijs/">Try it out</a>.
So we got object falling on the ground and slightly bouncing on it. Let's do just that.</p>

<center>
    <iframe width="100%" height="420" src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2012-06-05-3d-physics-with-three-js-and-physijs/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>


<p>First a classic. We create a tQuery.World. So you immediatly got
a scene, a renderer, camera and its controls. All that already
setup according to reasonable default.
 <code>.boilerplate()</code> adds
the <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/12/20/boilerplate-for-three-js/">"three.js boilerplate"</a>
we did last year. We disable the camera controls as it will stay still in this scene.
Then we <code>.start()</code> to launch the render loop.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>var world   = tQuery.createWorld().boilerplate({cameraControls: false}).start();
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now we setup the camera to be a bit far from the scene center. Thus
we got room to display larger objects</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>world.tCamera().position.set( 70, 40, 70 );
world.tCamera().lookAt( world.tScene().position );
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now we need to tell the renderer that shadow has to be casted. This is done by the simple lines below.
We saw the details in <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/01/20/casting-shadows/">"Casting Shadows"</a> post.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>world.tRenderer().shadowMapEnabled  = true;
world.tRenderer().shadowMapSoft     = true;
world.tRenderer().setClearColorHex( 0xffffff, 1 );
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now we enable the physics into the world.
this is important. From now on, all the physics-enabled object
of this world will move according to realistic physics rules.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>world.enablePhysics();
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Enlight your world</h2>

<p>Here we setup the lights. For simplicity sake, we will use only one directional light.
First we tune the position and color to fit our tastes. Dont be shy, play with those parameters to get a feel of it.
Then we tune shadow parameters.
Those can be tricky to tune.
You can find more details in <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/01/20/casting-shadows/">"Casting Shadow"</a> post.
It helps if you make the shaddow camera visible. You can do so with <code>.shadowCameraVisible(true)</code>.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>tQuery.createDirectionalLight().addTo(world)
    .position(20, 40, -15).color(0xffffff)
    .castShadow(true).shadowMap(512*2,512*2)
    .shadowCamera(60, -60, 60, -60, 20, 200)
    .shadowDarkness(0.7).shadowBias(.002)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Let's create a ground to stand on</h2>

<p>First we create the texture for our ground. We use <code>rocks.jpg</code> to have like a rock
effect. We use <code>.RepeatWrapping</code> to repeat the texture on the faces and get a
proper scale.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>var texture = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture( "images/rocks.jpg" );
texture.wrapS   = texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
texture.repeat.set( 3, 3 );
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In fact, the ground is only a cube which is wide and flat, a bit like
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth">old-vision of earth</a> :)
It is usual now, we setup the position, material and shadow.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>var ground  = tQuery.createCube(100, 1, 100).addTo(world)
    .position(0, -10, 0)
    .setLambertMaterial().map(texture).back()
    .receiveShadow(true)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now we just have to setup the physics for the ground. This is done
by <code>.enablePhysics()</code>. The <code>mass</code> parameter define the mass
of the object in the physics.
By default, it is automatically computed depending on the volume of the object.
Here zeroing the mass is a special case, which say
"the mass is infinite, dont move, ever" :)</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>ground.enablePhysics({
    mass    : 0
});
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Spawning object in a 3D world</h2>

<p>Spawning is always a delicate matter in our world.
But first let's load the texture for the spawned objects.
It is done outside of the loop thus it get reused. Aka it is sent
only once to the GPU for all the objects. This is an important
point from performance point of view. Last year,
<a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/09/16/performance-caching-material/">"Performance: Caching Material"</a>
post was about this very topic.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>var cTexture    = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture( "images/plywood.jpg" );
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now we declare <code>spawnObject()</code> which gonna take care of spawning one object.
So we create a cube, setup its position, rotation and material. This is all good. Oh dont
forget to use <code>.castShadow()</code> as got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mapping">shadow mapping</a> going on :)</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>var spawnObject = function(){
    var object  = tQuery.createCube(4,4,4).addTo(world)
        .rotation(Math.random()*Math.PI*2, Math.random()*Math.PI*2, Math.random()*Math.PI*2)
        .position(Math.random()*15-7.5, 25, Math.random()*15-7.5)
        .setLambertMaterial().map(cTexture).back()
        .castShadow(true)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Here we enable the physics on this object. So the world will handle all its move from now on.
It will object to physics laws according to the parameters you setup.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction">friction</a> is the force resisting when 2 objects slides against each other.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution">resititution</a> is how bouncy the object is.
For scientific definition, go read a book :)</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>    object.enablePhysics({
        friction    : 0.4,
        restitution : 0.6
    });
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now we gonna play with the 'collision' event. Physijs is able to notify
you when an object collide with another. Just use <code>.addEventListener()</code> on 'collision'.
Here we gonna change the color of the object depending on the number of collisions
they got.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>    var nCollisions = 0;
    object.physics().addEventListener('collision', function(){
        var colliColors = [0xcc8855, 0xbb9955, 0xaaaa55, 0x99bb55, 0x88cc55, 0x77dd55];
        if( ++nCollisions &lt; colliColors.length ){
            var color   = colliColors[nCollisions];
            object.get(0).material.color.setHex( color );
        }
    })
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now we simply use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval"><code>setInterval()</code></a> to
spawn an object every seconds.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>setInterval(spawnObject, 1000);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>And we are DONE! We got a realistic physics in our 3D world! not bad hey :)</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs">physijs</a>,
it is now possible to get full blown realistic physics
using
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/tquery">tQuery</a>.
It is a simple way to make scene more realistic. It is nice to experiment with.
I will do more on this very soon!</p>

<p>Thanks all folks! have fun :)</p>
