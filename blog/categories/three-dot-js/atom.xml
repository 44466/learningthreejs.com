    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is another edition of Three.js News. We have collected some original demos with skilful effects and lots of style. There is a high degree of talent displayed on these projects. In this episode, we will cycle through the daring climbs of the Tour de France. We will turn around decadent blue worlds, play with colourful Rubik's cube and take the new Renault Espace for a test run. We will also merge and morph with creative experiences and investigate fascinating generative compositions.</p>

<h3>Metropolis</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/metropolis.jpg" alt="metropolis" /></p>

<p><a href="https://alexstockdale.com/metropolis/">Metropolis</a> is an impressive demo by <a href="https://twitter.com/ALIXPLOX">Alex Stockdale</a>. It is a spheric vision of an urban world in destruction, or construction, depending on how you see it. It has a decadent aspect to it, the light is like the shadow of a dream and there is a hazy bluish shade in the atmosphere. This project is not only interactive and skilful but it is also a great example of what we can do with three.js.</p>

<h3>The Climb of Alpe d'Huez</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/the_climb_alpe_huez.jpg" alt="the_climb_alpe_huez" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2015/jul/23/tour-de-france-the-climb-of-alpe-dhuez-interactive">demo</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/amason">Andrew Mason</a>, Troy Griggs and Lawrence Ostlere, is a 3D representation of the Tour de France. We cycle a trail following the iconic Alpe d'huez climb. Step by step we learn about its history, about details of the trickiest passings and challenges to get to the summit....wonderful work by the talented devs at the guardian!</p>

<h3>Roobix</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/roobix.jpg" alt="roobix" /></p>

<p><a href="http://playcanv.as/p/V9B7k46n">Roobix</a> is a very fun game created by <a href="https://twitter.com/marquizzo">Marco del Valle</a> on <a href="https://playcanvas.com/">Play Canvas</a>. It is a Rubik's cube simulator with great animations. The rotations and puzzle combinations are extremely fun to play with. The cube is very reactive and the twinkling colours are part of the features that make this game unique.</p>

<h3>Renault Espace</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/renault_espace.jpg" alt="renault_espace" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.littleworkshop.fr/renaultespace/">demo</a> is an interactive prototype of the New Renault Space by <a href="https://twitter.com/glecollinet">Guillaume Collinet</a>. It is a webgl visualizer using real time 3d. You can go inside the car as if you were gonna take it out for a test drive. The interior and animations are life-like and will make you feel like you own it! You can visit Guillaume's <a href="http://www.littleworkshop.fr/">little workshop</a> for more stylish experiences.</p>

<h3>Omm Experience</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/omm_experience.jpg" alt="omm_experience" /></p>

<p><a href="http://ommexperience.com/">Omm Experience</a> shows us the fantastic world created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jhelf">Jean Helfenstein</a>. At first, there is an awesome lens flare effect with a halo of light glowing around a revolving asteroid. As the demo evolves, there are 3 chapters about creativity with great morphing and merging animations that transform and deform the object as if it was a ball of water.</p>

<h3>Gridiron</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/gridiron.jpg" alt="gridiron" /></p>

<p><a href="http://haptic-data.com/project/gridiron">Gridiron</a> is "an exploration of generative compositions based on vertical structures fighting for space" developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hapticdata">Kyle Phillips</a>. We can see procedurally generated geometries that rain up and fill the screen. We can also modify their properties and play with the effects. It kind of reminds me of chemistry class.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this edition of Three.js News we saw the talent behind daring and challenging experiences like the Tour de France, behind life-like animations and reactive games like Rubik's cube. We floated through procedurally generated worlds and through spheric decadent visions of a city. We took a drive around our imagination and witnessed creativity in its abstract form.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing. Stay tuned for more Three.js News and see you next time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>Recently people started to experiment with three.js and Chrome devtools. The excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/thespite">@thespite</a> first did <a href="https://github.com/spite/ShaderEditorExtension">Shader Editor Extension</a> and then <a href="https://twitter.com/thespite/status/624256879766712320">Three.js Editor Extension</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdoob">@mrdoob</a> did it too <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdoob/status/616042217464012800">here</a> where he links directly to the <a href="http://threejs.org/editor">three.js editor</a> itself. The goal is to make an extension which allows to inspect your page when you are debugging three.js.</p>

<p>All that is very early work, but the concept seems really promising. It will allow to interact with almost all three.js demos out there. It is a great tool to debug your own work, or to understand how a demo is done. You can even use it to fine tune your parameters.</p>

<p>I loved it so I decided to give it a shot. I forked @thespite work and looked at it over the last weekend. I reused the UI layer from the three.js editor, improved the UI a bit, and applied it to the Chrome Dev tools. The implementation still clearly has some quirks, but I love the concept. I believe it can be a very strong tool to debug three.js.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threejs-inspector/dnhjfclbfhcbcdfpjaeacomhbdfjbebi">Three.js Inspector Extension</a> on chrome app store and play with it.</p>

<h3><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threejs-inspector/dnhjfclbfhcbcdfpjaeacomhbdfjbebi">Install THREE.js Inspector</a></h3>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about the 10th episode of Three.js News. We are very happy to share exceptional demos with you every week. In all the 3D experiences we have shared on previous episodes, we have witnessed talent, dedication and skill. Without so many creative projects we wouldn't have been able to continue with the news. So, to celebrate this 10th edition, we are going to travel through space, time and even dimensions.</p>

<p>In this episode, we will explore other worlds and make musical journeys across decades and light years. We will wonder around the Parisian metro in a different light and be amazed by the simple beauty of land and stone. We will interact with the futuristic and be repelled by the terrestrial. We will learn to safeguard and preserve our cultural heritage through online 3D, and finally, take a walk through the magical woods of the imagination.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://metropolitain.io/">project</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/dataveyes/">Dataveyes</a> was made to represent the metro network of the Parisian underground. It is a Webgl data visualisation experience. It gives commuters information about the metro system, like journey times and people touching in at each station. It is dynamic and interactive. <a href="http://dataveyes.com/?em_x=22#!/en">Dataveyes' mission</a> is to transform human data into the best user experiences.</p>

<h3>I Want To See Other Worlds</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-24-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-10-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/i_want_to_see_other_worlds.jpg" alt="i_want_to_see_other_worlds" /></p>

<p><a href="http://primitive.be/prods/IWTSOW/">I want to see other worlds</a> by <a href="http://primitive.be/">Primitive</a>. Have you ever dreamed about traveling through space and time? If the answer is yes, then you are gonna love this demo. Primitive is a demo group with outstanding projects in their record. In this webgl demo you can see various elements floating through space. It is raw and pure at the same time. You will see transformations, visit fantastic universes and be driven through planets of the imagination</p>

<h3>Everything Is Fashion</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-24-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-10-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/everything_is_fashion.jpg" alt="everything_is_fashion" /></p>

<p><a href="http://stianj.com/fashion/">Everything is fashion</a> is a design and rhythmic demo created by <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=65978">Ninjadev</a>. It is colourful, fun and its got style. You feel as if you are travelling through time with the music. You go through decades, 80's, 90's...etc. The transitions are impressive and keep up with the beat, great and simple effects. It is both old-school and futuristic</p>

<h3>Light Year</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-24-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-10-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/lightyear.jpg" alt="lightyear" /></p>

<p><a href="http://lightyear.fm/">Lightyear</a> is a very cool experience developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mikelacher">Mike Lacher</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/blackmika">Mika Chernov</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lanewinfield">Brian Moore</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ilovechrisbaker">Chris Baker</a>. In this awesome demo you can hear how far music hits have travelled through Space. Music waves from radio broadcasts leave Earth at the speed of light. You can scroll to move away from Earth and you will hear songs that go way back ....even 100 light years.</p>

<h3>Bon Appetit</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-24-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-10-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/bon_appetit.jpg" alt="bon_appetit" /></p>

<p><a href="http://quasimondo.com/threejs/bon_appetit.html">Bon appetit</a> is a "creeping on your skin" demo by creative coder <a href="https://twitter.com/quasimondo">Mario Klingemann</a>. It will truly make you loose your appetite. It is a realistic and big slimy worm crawling on your screen. The texture is very cool and life-like. The slithering creature is in the form of a torus knot which makes it even more disturbing when it moves!</p>

<h3>Future Citizen</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-24-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-10-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/future_citizen.jpg" alt="future_citizen" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://ftrctzn.com/">demo</a> is a funky presentation of Future citizen, a studio making interactive web experiences for brands. It is creative and hypnotic. You can see the net of waves flow towards and against the letters. If you move your mouse around to trigger the effect, you will see that the interactions are pretty neat.</p>

<h3>Kessler Syndrome</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-24-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-10-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/kessler_syndrome.jpg" alt="kessler_syndrome" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/kessler-syndrome">Kessler Syndrome</a> is a Chrome Experiment developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/wj_field">Will Field</a>. In this demo we can see the amounts of space trash that have been produced by space travel. The idea is to track some of that trash in real time. The red dots are points where the debris fly past each other at close range. In the bottom left we can fast forward to see all the potential future collisions of trash around Earth.</p>

<h3>Red Stone</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-24-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-10-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/red_stone.jpg" alt="red_stone" /></p>

<p><a href="http://potemkin.se/redstone/">Red Stone</a> is a beautifully polished demo made with <a href="http://goocreate.com/">Goo Create</a>. It was done by <a href="https://twitter.com/herrpotemkin">Magnus Östergren</a>, their creative director. The scene is like a desert with some subtle wildlife on it. It has wonderful lighting and shadow casting moving around the stone. It was made with an iphone 6. This is just an example of the cool things you can do with the Goo Create tool.</p>

<h3>Mount Rushmore</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-24-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-10-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/mount_rushmore.jpg" alt="mount_rushmore" /></p>
