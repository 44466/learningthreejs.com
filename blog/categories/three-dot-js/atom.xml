    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This demo shows Hatsune Miku dancing in augmented reality within
your browser! This is great and surprisingly easy to do.
All that running on your browser, based on web standards.
I did it to show it was possible to do AR within the browser. I wanted to share the code to see what you guys can do with it.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-07-16-hatsune-miku-dancing-in-augmented-reality/screenshots/screenshot-nexus9.png" width="350"></p>

<p>Best of all, it even runs on mobile phones that
support WebGL and WebRTC.
The screenshot on the right is made on a nexus.
So we can do augmented reality within the browser on mobile</p>

<blockquote><p>We can do augmented reality within the browser on currently deployed mobile phones.
There is  nothing to wait for.</p></blockquote>

<h2>How is it coded ?</h2>

<p>It is mainly a link of 2 parts.
First <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.webar">webar extensions</a>
for three.js. They bundle what is needed to handle augmented reality with three.js, from the webcam setup to the marker localisation.
Second part is the <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_loader_mmd">mmd loader</a> which loads the model. It loads the Hatsune Miku model and its animations.</p>

<p>Once you got those 2 parts, things are simple :) you just have to display your model where your marker is.
To know the tech details, you will have to dig in <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_loader_mmd">the</a>
<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.webar">code</a>.
I will likely talk more about AR tho.</p>

<h2>Now Let's Do a Bit of History</h2>

<p>I did this to show it was possible to do AR within the browser and to share the code to see what you guys can do with it.
It was for a <a href="http://daqri.com/dublinhacks/">AR oriented hackathon</a> in Dublin.
It recently landed a <a href="https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/572435641079877632">new job</a> at <a href="http://daqri.com">Daqri</a>. Part of my job is developer relations, so I get to help people doing AR. I love it :)</p>

<p>All the code to handle Hatsune Miku is from
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/takahiro-aoyagi/96/10a/41a">Takahiro Aoyagi</a>.
He did a <a href="http://github.io/takahirox/three.js">fork on three.js</a> to load mmd formats, the format used to store Hatsune Miku.
It may be included in three.js soon.
Here is his <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_loader_mmd">example for three.js</a>
It all started with his <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/mmd-viewer-js/">mmd viewer</a> in pure webgl.
The original contains a LOT of neat features like inverse kinetic, physics for the hair,
a toon shader to make the color more cartoonish, a edge shader to enhance the outline of the model
like a drawing.
He is doing excellent work. Check him out on twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/superhoge">@superhoge</a>.</p>

<p>Let's have a word about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku">Hatsune Miku</a> herself.
It is such a nice story.
She is a Japanese star but she is purely virtual.
She is a humanoid persona which appears as a drawing or as a hologram.
There is no human behind, even for the voice!
When she sings, what you hear is a voice synthesizer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypton_Future_Media">crypton</a>
All that is crazy but true :)</p>

<p>She even does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEaBqiLeCu0">concerts</a> where thousand of fans are go to see her.
Actual human fans I mean, not virtual ones.
As you can see, Hatsune Miku is no stranger to augmented reality.
I love her!</p>

<h2>How To Run The Demo ?</h2>

<p>You may want to run this demo obviously.
Here is how to do it.
First you put the <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/demo.hatsunemiku-augmentedreality">demo url</a> in your browser.
It will read your webcam using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia">getUserMedia</a>. When it asks for permission, allow it :)
Then you need to put this <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.webar/demo.hatsunemiku-augmentedreality/image-marker-265.html">AR marker</a> in front of the camera.
You can print it and point the camera toward the paper
or you can load the marker web page and put the phone in front of the camera.
And now you can see Hatsune Mike Dancing in Augmented Reality.</p>

<p>Now let's look at it in action in this little screencast.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://learningthreejs.com//www.youtube.com/embed/ObVR2mOM-3Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you want to experiment with augmented reality and three.js, checkout <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.webar">threex.webar</a>.
It is so cool to make augmented reality on the web!
I hope you have as much fun as I had doing it :)
I can't wait to see what augmented reality will do on mobile's browsers.</p>

<p>That's all folks. Have fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is another post for Three.js News. In this eighth edition we are going to travel and dance with cubes, discover Swiss ground with points, and do some commuting with lines. We have a couple of educational viewers, one for asteroids and another, less space related but equally exact, for terrains. We will enjoy turning around with funky vertex and spinning helix. We will discover some beautiful models skillfully displayed in Three.js. We will also be able to measure and forecast happiness.</p>

<p>Beautiful <a href="http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/YXxmYR?utm_content=buffer71fab&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">demo</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/yakudoo">Yakudoo</a>. We saw paranoid birds in another three.js news. Now its time for the king of the jungle. You will see a very cute animation of a lion who is in desperate need of chillin' and refreshment. It must be a very warm summer day for him. By clicking you activate the ventilation and  when turning around with your mouse you make wind blow in every direction. The lion will definitely appreciate. He will actually smile.</p>

<h3>Holy Running Cow</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/holy_running_cow.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 40 36" /></p>

<p>This is another <a href="http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/rVGraP">demo</a> done by Yakudoo. He really has a talent for creating fun animal characters! You can see  a very cute cow running around. When you press and drag the scene rotates, and the cow tries to pick up the pace.</p>

<p>This one is a captivating <a href="http://freelance-html-developer.com/clock/">demo</a> and a Chrome Experiment developed by <a href="http://freelance-html-developer.com/">Tomasz Slawnikowski</a>, a freelance html developer. It measures time in an original frame. Every second is drawn according to the hour passing by. If you look a it for a while you will feel in a state of unreality, in a haze, hypnotic state. Even if it appears unstable, the clock is ticking!</p>

<h3>Crazy Skills</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/crazy_skills.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 43 42" /></p>

<p>Very kaleidoscopic <a href="http://chrisirhc.github.io/_experiment-sand-webgl/push-field.html">experiment</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisirhc">Chris Chua</a>. In this demo Chris plays around with shaders in WebGL to simulate force over an area. You can click and drag your mouse around to see how a trail is designed, go faster or slower. It almost resembles a small fish in the water.</p>

<h3>I'll be back</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/ill_be_back.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 45 27" /></p>

<p>This awesome cinematographic <a href="http://www.insidious-movie.net/entertheroom/">experience</a> will make your hairs stand on end. The first two episodes of the Insidious movie saga really frightened me. I'm anxiously waiting for the new one. This demo is not reassuring. I think i'm gonna be even more scared! You explore the room around you and click on the hot spots, the story will develop with each click. The effects will have you screaming your heart out!</p>

<h3>1 Million Particles</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/1million_particles.jpg" alt="1million_particles" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://codepen.io/edankwan/pen/QbMxWp">demo</a> shows us a beautiful and subtile way of creating particles in codepen.io. Developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/edankwan">Edan Kwan</a> using curl noise and fbo on three.js. He produced a very professional and fascinating effect.

<p>In his <a href="http://aaron-meyers.com/!/">portfolio</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/aarontweets">Aaron Meyers</a> creates a very cool environment. We can see his skills as a developer in this original homepage.Turn around in the room and by clicking on each TV screen you can explore the works he has done. You can also click on Aaron himself to know a bit more about him. This is hands down one of the most creative portfolios I have seen.</p>

<h3>Realize project</h3>

<p>If you liked the movie Ghost in the Shell you are going to love this <a href="http://www.realize-project.jp/">project</a> It is an homage made by true fans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a> is a manga by Masamune Shirow, there was also a movie made of it. This demo captures the universe of the manga pretty well. You can turn around and decide which icon to pop-up. There are very cool neon lights in the space, it gives it kind of a Tron aspect. You can also take a look at posts on VR and AI from other news-based sites.</p>

<h3>A world of change</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/a_world_of_change.jpg" alt="a_world_of_change" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://news-lab-trends-experiment.appspot.com/">demo</a> is part of <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>. It is a great idea for social impact. Through google search you can click on topic (recycling, energy, water, natural environment, pollution) or a city, and see how those searches reflect the way the world thinks about climate change. You can discover what certain cities are doing about the environment. It is an eye opener and a great way to encourage sustainable development</p>

<h3>Terminator Genisys</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/terminator_genisys.jpg" alt="terminator_genisys" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.terminatorgenisysmovie.co.uk/insidelook/">Terminator Genisys</a> is another successful and  cinema based demo created my <a href="https://twitter.com/ParamountUK">Paramount Pictures</a>. You can get an amazing inside of the characters by rotating the camera to explore 3d models. You can also zoom in and click on hotspots for information and videos about the movie coming soon. It is very fun.</p>

<h3>Show Off "Le Petit Chef"</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/le_petit_chef.jpg" alt="le_petit_chef" /></p>

<p>Special mention to this great experience that we found. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBJEP4lsRFY&amp;feature=youtu.be">Le Petit Chef</a> is a masterpiece created by the guys at <a href="http://www.skullmapping.com/">Skull Mapping</a>, <a href="http://www.filipsterckx.be/">Filip Sterckx</a> and <a href="http://www.antoon.be/">Antoon Verbeek</a>. They experimented with projection on a dinner table. Combining 3d animation and motion capture, a miniature chef turns your dish into a grill and cooks right in front of your astonished eyes. I wish I could book a place at this table! It is an awesome experience that I'm sure you will love.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this episode of Three.js News we have seen awesome projects. All very vivid and lifelike. Some movie related and some really scary, others more realistic and down to protecting earth. They all have their own universe. We experienced physics and particles, projection and motion capture. Regardless of how or by whom they were developed, all these experiences show us what is possible to create in the amazing universe of 3D.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post explores original demos with lots of knowledge. In this episode of Three.js News we will take a tour around 4D dimensions and creative subdivisions. We will also travel over webs of information and have fun with wildlife games. There is a lot of diversity in these projects, but one thing is for sure, they are all developed with the utmost skill and created for the maximum effect.</p>

<h3>Paranoid vs. Shy Birds</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/paranoid_vs_shy_birds.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p>This is a very fun <a href="http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/LVyJXw">demo</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/yakudoo">Yakudoo</a> on CodePen. The bird characters are so cute. The one in the middle is the paranoid one. You can move his head around and see how he interacts with the small shy birds. The HTML, CSS and Javascript are visible on the scene.</p>

<h3>Threepark</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/threepark.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p><a href="http://threepark.net/English">Threepark</a> is a cool editor developed by <a href="https://github.com/liguocn">liguocn</a>. Easy to understand and to use, great for artists and 3d lovers. You can create different models and designs. You even have a library of templates to use. Subdivide a model as many times as you like in the <a href="http://threepark.net/English/cagemodeling">cagemodeling</a> canvas. You can also store your models in the cloud and export them into 3d printing format. Great way to unleash your creativity.</p>

<h3>Parrot Hunt</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/parrot_hunt.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p>Very funky retro <a href="http://parrothunt.nergal.se:8080/">game</a>, and also a Chrome Experiment, created by  Magnus Persson aka <a href="https://twitter.com/lallassu">nergal</a> . The idea is to shoot only the parrots, not the flamingos. You can move around and reload your rifle to keep shooting at your prey. Fortunately its not real hunting! You can get really serious and try to improve your score every time like I did! It's really enjoyable and it makes you feel like a great aim.</p>

<h3>Ntype</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/ntype.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p><a href="http://ntype.blue/#speed=0.015707963267948967&amp;rotationPlanes=xw,xz,yw,yz,zw&amp;fpr=100&amp;string=NTYPE&amp;drawForms=true&amp;drawTrails=false">Ntype</a> is another Chrome Experiment demo developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinzweerink">Kevin Zweerink</a>. It shows us a compelling and interesting way to explore 4D. The typography is extruded into the 4d dimension. You can change the parameters and settings and customise the rotation planes. You can even modify the trails that the letters leave behind them. There are also a lot of other designs to explore in Kevin's <a href="http://kevinzweerink.com/">homepage</a></p>

<h3>WikiGalaxy</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/wiki_galaxy.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.polyfra.me/#">WikiGalaxy</a> is a beautiful and original demo created by <a href="https://twitter.com/WikiGalaxy">Owen Cornec</a>. This experiment takes us to a fantastic space that we actually already use everyday life. We can visualise Wikipedia as a galactic web of information. It's a marvellous world of knowledge. There is a map where you can fly over the planets, zoom and search. Wikipedia articles are stars, interests are nebulas. Have a good time learning! You can see more WebGL visualisations  in Owen's <a href="http://www.polyfra.me/">portfolio</a></p>

<h3>Multivers3D</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-18-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-5-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/multivers3d.jpg" alt="screen shot 2015-06-17 at 11 00 12" /></p>

<p>This is the first <a href="https://multivers3d.fr/#/51184/Home.html">video game demo</a> released by the <a href="https://twitter.com/INF1N1T">multivers3d</a> team. It supports multi-users, cross platforms and it has zero install. This first episode is called Earth Creed. You are a honey bee and you need to harvest pollen and nectar from your environment. You have to use your judgement to equilibrate the balance of the ecosystem. This game will definitely make you love nature.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this post, we discovered some varied and original demos. We traveled through a space of information and explored 4D dimensions. We also played very funky games and designed 3D models with various subdivisions. The experience each of these demos give us is unique. Keep creating such wonderful projects.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Three.js News. See you next time.</p>
