    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>This post is about edition 14 of Three.js News. Our favorite demos of last week were very fun to play around with. There were some set above the clouds, staring directly at the sun. Some were cool webgl experiences inspired by games and movies. Some showed a brilliant use of shaders and VR technology. And we even met a three.js sock puppet!</p>

<h3>Evolution</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-09-01-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-14-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/evolution.jpg" alt="evolution" /></p>

<p>This breathtaking <a href="http://vrse.com/watch/?id=6">project</a> is a photo-realistic CGI-rendered 3D Virtual Reality film on three.js player. "It takes the viewer on a journey from one beginning to a new beginning." It was made for <a href="https://twitter.com/vrse">Vrse</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is to announce Three.js office hours. A practical and easy way to get answers to your questions.
The principle is simple: you post your questions on twitter with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23learningthreejs">#learningthreejs</a>
hashtag and we will try to answer them.</p>

<p>It is a direct channel for the three.js community.  We told ourselves that since our blog is about learning three.js, our mission is to coach and guide willing learners. We are starting it as an experiment, we will try it out and see how it goes. We noticed that people out there have many queries. Whether you are working with it as part of a project, or experimenting with it as a hobby, three.js can be tricky. We have been receiving emails and notifications with kind words (thank you for that!)... and a lot of questions too :) You expect answers and we want to deliver them.</p>

<p>So the idea behind Three.js office hours is to help you get around your troublesome issues. If you are stuck and don't understand something we encourage you to post your questions in the Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23learningthreejs">#learningthreejs</a>. If you have sent us queries before and we have overlooked them (sorry for that), please don't hesitate to ask about it on the hashtag.</p>

<p>We will then pick up questions that you guys posted and record a short video. We will answer them one by one, giving you detailed advice and useful pointers. In addition to that, we will write a blogpost about the content of the video, and publish it so you can come back to it whenever you want.</p>

<p>Thanks for participating in this experience with us. We are sure your questions will benefit the whole three.js community, so don't be shy!</p>

<p>There is always something new to learn ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody</p>

<p>Welcome to a new episode of Three.js News. This time we will discover some artistic and abstract demos. We will go through them at fast speed, see them grow, expand and dissolve. We will also get a bit spooked by a creepy head!</p>

<h3>Bjork's website</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/bjork.jpg" alt="bjork" /></p>

<p>Beause arty design is also a three.js matter, here is a beautiful <a href="http://bjork.com/">demo</a> created by Vince Mckelvie from <a href="https://twitter.com/mmparisdotcom">M/M</a> design agency in Paris. It's singer Bjork's new website.</p>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/meander.jpg" alt="meander" /></p>

<p><a href="http://codedoodl.es/_/inconvergent/meander">Meander</a> consists of randomly generated organic sand-storm clouds that dance around the screen. Its author, <a href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent">Anders Hoff</a> shared this via <a href="http://codedoodl.es/">Codedoodl</a> a tool to create original code sketches.</p>

<h3>Arrows</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/arrows.jpg" alt="arrows" /></p>

<p>Like a painting in a canvas, this <a href="http://codedoodl.es/_/cabbibo/arrows">demo</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Cabbibo">Cabbibo</a> is abstract and bursting with colour. The arrows wander around like small brush strokes in 3D. You can also find it at <a href="http://codedoodl.es/">Codedoodl</a>.</p>

<h3>Signal barrel</h3>

<h3>Fungal State</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/fungal_state.jpg" alt="fungal_state" /></p>

<p>This evolutive <a href="http://gregtatum.com/poems/growth/#/2-fungus">demo</a> was created by the talented <a href="https://twitter.com/TatumCreative">Greg Tatum</a>. It shows us a dynamic and realtime growing fungus shape. It is part of Greg's <a href="http://gregtatum.com/blog/">Growth series</a>.</p>

<h3>Creepy Head</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-25-learning-three-dot-js-news-number-13-creative-demos-of-the-week/screenshots/creepy_head.jpg" alt="creepy_head" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://codepen.io/SaschaSigl/full/MwMOag/">demo</a> is a creepy morph animation made with javascript. It was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/SaschaSigl">Sascha Sigl</a> on <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>. The way the mouth moves and the eyes follow you is kind of disturbing and spooky :)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Okay guys, that's all the news for this week. We discovered some very artistic, abstract and fast paced projects. Some evolving and expanding, morphing and growing...and some freaking us out! In any case, they are all creative and fun.</p>

<p>We recently <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2015/07/30/three-dot-js-inspector-in-chrome-devtools/">announced three.js inspector</a>. This chrome devtools extension allows you to inspect the three.js within your page, directly from devtools.</p>

<p>It is also a great debugging tool! With it you can learn how three.js demos are made, interact with them and modify their parameters. You can grab it on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threejs-inspector/dnhjfclbfhcbcdfpjaeacomhbdfjbebi">chrome web store</a> and give it a try. It is definitely fun to work on :) We had some long week ends with sleepless nights, and now the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threejs-inspector/dnhjfclbfhcbcdfpjaeacomhbdfjbebi">Three.js Inspector 1.2.5</a> is released !</p>

<h3><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threejs-inspector/dnhjfclbfhcbcdfpjaeacomhbdfjbebi">Install THREE.js Inspector</a></h3>
