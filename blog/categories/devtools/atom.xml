    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>Recently people started to experiment with three.js and Chrome devtools. The excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/thespite">@thespite</a> first did <a href="https://github.com/spite/ShaderEditorExtension">Shader Editor Extension</a> and then <a href="https://twitter.com/thespite/status/624256879766712320">Three.js Editor Extension</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdoob">@mrdoob</a> did it too <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdoob/status/616042217464012800">here</a> where he links directly to the <a href="http://threejs.org/editor">three.js editor</a> itself. The goal is to make an extension which allows to inspect your page when you are debugging three.js.</p>

<p>All that is very early work, but the concept seems really promising. It will allow to interact with almost all three.js demos out there. It is a great tool to debug your own work, or to understand how a demo is done. You can even use it to fine tune your parameters.</p>

<p>I loved it so I decided to give it a shot. I forked @thespite work and looked at it over the last weekend. I reused the UI layer from the three.js editor, improved the UI a bit, and applied it to the Chrome Dev tools. The implementation still clearly has some quirks, but I love the concept. I believe it can be a very strong tool to debug three.js.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threejs-inspector/dnhjfclbfhcbcdfpjaeacomhbdfjbebi">Three.js Inspector Extension</a> on chrome app store and play with it.</p>
