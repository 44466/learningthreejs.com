    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>This post is about edition 14 of Three.js News. Our favorite demos of last week were very fun to play around with. There were some set above the clouds, staring directly at the sun. Some were cool webgl experiences inspired by games and movies. Some showed a brilliant use of shaders and VR technology. And we even met a three.js sock puppet!</p>

<h3>Evolution</h3>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody</p>

<p>Welcome to a new episode of Three.js News. This time we will discover some artistic and abstract demos. We will go through them at fast speed, see them grow, expand and dissolve. We will also get a bit spooked by a creepy head!</p>

<h3>Bjork's website</h3>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is another edition of Three.js News. We have collected some original demos with skilful effects and lots of style. There is a high degree of talent displayed on these projects. In this episode, we will cycle through the daring climbs of the Tour de France. We will turn around decadent blue worlds, play with colourful Rubik's cube and take the new Renault Espace for a test run. We will also merge and morph with creative experiences and investigate fascinating generative compositions.</p>

<h3>Metropolis</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/metropolis.jpg" alt="metropolis" /></p>

<p><a href="https://alexstockdale.com/metropolis/">Metropolis</a> is an impressive demo by <a href="https://twitter.com/ALIXPLOX">Alex Stockdale</a>. It is a spheric vision of an urban world in destruction, or construction, depending on how you see it. It has a decadent aspect to it, the light is like the shadow of a dream and there is a hazy bluish shade in the atmosphere. This project is not only interactive and skilful but it is also a great example of what we can do with three.js.</p>

<h3>The Climb of Alpe d'Huez</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/the_climb_alpe_huez.jpg" alt="the_climb_alpe_huez" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2015/jul/23/tour-de-france-the-climb-of-alpe-dhuez-interactive">demo</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/amason">Andrew Mason</a>, Troy Griggs and Lawrence Ostlere, is a 3D representation of the Tour de France. We cycle a trail following the iconic Alpe d'huez climb. Step by step we learn about its history, about details of the trickiest passings and challenges to get to the summit....wonderful work by the talented devs at the guardian!</p>

<h3>Roobix</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/roobix.jpg" alt="roobix" /></p>

<p><a href="http://playcanv.as/p/V9B7k46n">Roobix</a> is a very fun game created by <a href="https://twitter.com/marquizzo">Marco del Valle</a> on <a href="https://playcanvas.com/">Play Canvas</a>. It is a Rubik's cube simulator with great animations. The rotations and puzzle combinations are extremely fun to play with. The cube is very reactive and the twinkling colours are part of the features that make this game unique.</p>

<h3>Renault Espace</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/renault_espace.jpg" alt="renault_espace" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.littleworkshop.fr/renaultespace/">demo</a> is an interactive prototype of the New Renault Space by <a href="https://twitter.com/glecollinet">Guillaume Collinet</a>. It is a webgl visualizer using real time 3d. You can go inside the car as if you were gonna take it out for a test drive. The interior and animations are life-like and will make you feel like you own it! You can visit Guillaume's <a href="http://www.littleworkshop.fr/">little workshop</a> for more stylish experiences.</p>

<h3>Omm Experience</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/omm_experience.jpg" alt="omm_experience" /></p>

<p><a href="http://ommexperience.com/">Omm Experience</a> shows us the fantastic world created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jhelf">Jean Helfenstein</a>. At first, there is an awesome lens flare effect with a halo of light glowing around a revolving asteroid. As the demo evolves, there are 3 chapters about creativity with great morphing and merging animations that transform and deform the object as if it was a ball of water.</p>

<h3>Gridiron</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-08-07-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-11-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/gridiron.jpg" alt="gridiron" /></p>

<p><a href="http://haptic-data.com/project/gridiron">Gridiron</a> is "an exploration of generative compositions based on vertical structures fighting for space" developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hapticdata">Kyle Phillips</a>. We can see procedurally generated geometries that rain up and fill the screen. We can also modify their properties and play with the effects. It kind of reminds me of chemistry class.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this edition of Three.js News we saw the talent behind daring and challenging experiences like the Tour de France, behind life-like animations and reactive games like Rubik's cube. We floated through procedurally generated worlds and through spheric decadent visions of a city. We took a drive around our imagination and witnessed creativity in its abstract form.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing. Stay tuned for more Three.js News and see you next time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about the 10th episode of Three.js News. We are very happy to share exceptional demos with you every week. In all the 3D experiences we have shared on previous episodes, we have witnessed talent, dedication and skill. Without so many creative projects we wouldn't have been able to continue with the news. So, to celebrate this 10th edition, we are going to travel through space, time and even dimensions.</p>

<p>In this episode, we will explore other worlds and make musical journeys across decades and light years. We will wonder around the Parisian metro in a different light and be amazed by the simple beauty of land and stone. We will interact with the futuristic and be repelled by the terrestrial. We will learn to safeguard and preserve our cultural heritage through online 3D, and finally, take a walk through the magical woods of the imagination.</p>

<p><a href="http://quasimondo.com/threejs/bon_appetit.html">Bon appetit</a> is a "creeping on your skin" demo by creative coder <a href="https://twitter.com/quasimondo">Mario Klingemann</a>. It will truly make you loose your appetite. It is a realistic and big slimy worm crawling on your screen. The texture is very cool and life-like. The slithering creature is in the form of a torus knot which makes it even more disturbing when it moves!</p>

<p>This <a href="http://ftrctzn.com/">demo</a> is a funky presentation of Future citizen, a studio making interactive web experiences for brands. It is creative and hypnotic. You can see the net of waves flow towards and against the letters. If you move your mouse around to trigger the effect, you will see that the interactions are pretty neat.</p>

In this demo we can see the amounts of space trash that have been produced by space travel. The idea is to track some of that trash in real time. The red dots are points where the debris fly past each other at close range. In the bottom left we can fast forward to see all the potential future collisions of trash around Earth.</p>
