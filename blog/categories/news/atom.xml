<p>It is inspiring to see how many great demos are out there in the 3D world. I wish I could make them fit all in one episode. But it's okay, I'll do my best to keep up with your creative minds.</p>

<h3>Nightmarish Tentacles</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/nightmarish_tentacles.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 34 41" /></p>

<p>This is <a href="http://grgrdvrt.com/miam/sweet_dream/">demo</a> is so cool. It was created by the imagination of <a href="https://twitter.com/grgrdvrt">Gregoire Divaret</a> and it is fantastically twisted. It is perfect for a Halloween night! You can see the tentacles moving like snakes entwined with each other. Zoom in very close in full screen for a great fright.</p>

<h3>Generative Tree</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/generative_tree.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 36 03" /></p>

<p>This is another <a href="http://grgrdvrt.com/miam/treee/">demo</a> developed by Gregoire Divaret. The tree grows from the beginning and expands into shape. It is beautifully designed and it has a really nice lighting. You can turn around and see it from different angles.  Be sure to check out Gregoire's <a href="http://grgrdvrt.com/">website</a> for all his cool experiences with WebGL</p>

<h3>The Fallen of WWII</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/the_fallen_wwii.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 38 55" /></p>

<p>The Fallen of WWII or <a href="http://www.fallen.io/ww2/#">fallen.io</a> is a data drive documentary about war and peace. Directed and coded by <a href="https://twitter.com/neilhalloran">Neil Halloran</a> it examines the human cost of the second World War. It can be watched on video through mobile, Apple TV and Chromecast. You can also watch the interactive version which allows you to pause at key moments in the video to interact with charts and numbers. This touching project is a way to remember and never forget the devastating consequences of war.</p>

<h3>Gugelmann Galaxy</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/gugelmann_galaxy.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 40 57" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mathiasbernhard.ch/gugelmann/">Gugelmann Galaxy</a> is a very artistic experience created by <a href="https://twitter.com/w0rb1t">Matthias Bernhard</a>. This awesome demo is a great way to explore the image galaxy live in the browser with three.js. It is very educational, you can arrange the paintings by color, technique or description. Bonus points since it also has a Google cardboard version. Don't forget to check out the <a href="http://www.mathiasbernhard.ch/gugelmann-galaxy/">blogpost</a> to see how it was developed.</p>

<h3>Procedural Star</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/procedural_star.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 42 46" /></p>

<p>Procedural Star is an excellent <a href="http://bruno-simon.com/lab/procedural-star/">demo</a> with great colors and effects. It was designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/bruno_simon">Bruno Simon</a>. The star is great for any space game, you can turn it around, zooming in and out and see the smooth movements it has. You can also change the parameters to customise it as much as you like. Bruno's <a href="http://bruno-simon.com/">website</a> is filled with other amazing projects he has worked on.</p>

<h3>Enough</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/enough.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 43 35" /></p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/129003739">Enough</a> is an interactive picture book created by Isaac Cohen or <a href="https://twitter.com/cabbibo">Cabbibo</a>. It is a beautifully artistic and immersive adventure into a world of dreams. It makes the technology appear as if it were alive. It is wonderfully designed and it has a oneiric sense to it. In Cabbibo's <a href="http://cabbi.bo/">website</a> you can see all his other creations and be amazed by his skill.</p>

<h3>Experiment for Google IO 2015</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/experiment_google_io.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 46 03" /></p>

<p>This is a very fun and playful <a href="http://www.clicktorelease.com/code/io15/">demo</a> coded by <a href="https://twitter.com/thespite">Jaume Sanchez</a> for the latest Google IO. You play with the Is and the O by clicking on them. They react, with very good physics, by jumping around. There is also an option to change the camera and look at it from different angles.</p>

<h3>Pregoneros de Medellin</h3>

<p><img src="/data/2015-06-05-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/pregoneros_de_medellin.png" alt="screen shot 2015-06-05 at 11 47 45" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pregonerosdemedellin.com/#en">Pregoneros de Medellin</a> is a breathtaking and very interactive street walk experience developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tibbb">Thibault Durand</a> and his talented team. It was created using a GoPro and Javascript. You can read the <a href="https://medium.com/@tibbb/how-we-created-an-immersive-street-walk-experience-with-a-gopro-and-javascript-f442cf8aa2dd">post</a> on how it was produced. In this web documentary you walk around Medellin city in Colombia and listen to the street-vendors cries, which are very traditional in the cultural Colombian landscape. You can click on each vendor to watch a video of his typical day to day life. I just loved it!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this blogpost we talked about some wonderful demos and very artistic projects. We were very impressed by the rich experiences that lead to web documentaries and interesting publications. All these demos are very interactive and show the amazing things we can do with 3D on the web.</p>

<p>We also want to thank our readers. We love it when developers out there send us their stuff, new and creative demos that we can share.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Three.js news. See you next time.</p>

<p>In this second edition of Three.js news we have collected very creative and funky demos. Some of them  were developed for both desktop and mobile phones. Some are games, some are just pure fun. Using the latest technologies, they are all a clear example of what's possible to do with web 3D today.</p>

<h2>Inconvergent Waves</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/inconvergent_waves.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 42 57" />
<a href="http://inconvergent.net/waves/">Inconvergent waves</a> is a nicely done demo by <a href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent">Anders Hoff</a>. You can create waves by moving your mouse around. It's like making ripples on the water. This technique is actually used as a method for generating landscapes. It's very reactive and the movements are smooth and natural. Visit the inconvergent <a href="http://inconvergent.net/">website</a> to check out the developing process.</p>

<h2>Interactive WebGL globes</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/interactive_webgl_globe.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 57 30" />
<a href="http://projects.delimited.io/webgl-globes/example_4_interactive_globe.html">Interactive WebGL</a> globes is a great way to improve your geography skills! This very educational and fun demo is a creation of <a href="https://twitter.com/delimitedtech">Steve Hall</a>. You mouseover the countries that you want and turn around by clicking on the interactive globe. Don't hesitate to read Steve's <a href="http://www.delimited.io/blog/2015/5/16/interactive-webgl-globes-with-threejs-and-d3">blogpost</a> to know more about his implementation of D3 and Three.js.</p>

<h2>Spiral Circle</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/spiral_circle.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 58 52" /></p>

<p><a href="http://projects.delimited.io/subunit/demos/spiral-circle-v2.html">Spiral Circle</a> is another cool demo created by Steve Hall. It is based on <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">mbostock’s</a> <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2472e84f78fd03df443f">example</a>. It is extremely hypnotic and it has kind of a disturbing texture, like the skin of a snake monster or something. You can pan to the left to divide the circle in two. Be careful, it's alive!</p>

<h2>Hatsune Miku</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/hatsune_miku_threejs.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 00 53" /></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku">Hatsune Miku</a> is a Three.js example <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_loader_mmd.html">demo</a> done by <a href="https://twitter.com/superhoge">takahiro</a>. It's a very fun demo even if takahiro is still working on improving it. This very cute blue hair girl is Japan's sweetheart. She dances in holograms and does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSyWtESoeOc">live concerts</a>...yeah i'm not kidding! We are even trying to bring her to life in <a href="https://twitter.com/LearningThreejs/status/600740523574439937">AR</a>.</p>

<h2>Race Against Oblivion</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/race_against_oblivion.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 59 58" /></p>

<p>Race against oblivion or <a href="http://www.timeshift165.com/game">Timeshift</a> is an  original game made by <a href="http://www.ultranoir.com/en/#!/home/">Utranoir</a>. Inspired on the story of a unique French car : The Delahaye 165, you have to race against time to save this one of a kind automobile. The presentation of the game is outstanding, it has great design, background and effects. Bonus, it can be played on both desktop and mobile!</p>

<h2>A Particle Dream</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/a_particle_dream.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 03 05" />
A Particle dream is a <a href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/particle-dream">demo</a> created by <a href="http://www.iamnop.com/">Nop Jiarathanakul</a>. It is one of the latest Chrome experiments. It is a wonderful simulation of particles moving smoothly around. You can choose the shape you want the particles to morph into. The music and the ambiance mix together for a very relaxing result. Oh and you can actually use <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> in this demo.</p>

<h2>Our Galactic Neighbourhood</h2>

<p><img src="/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/our_galactic_neighborhood.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 02 06" /></p>

<p><a href="http://charliehoey.com/threejs-demos/our-galactic-neighborhood.html">Our Galactic Neighbourhood</a>
is another very educational demo. Developed by creative coder <a href="http://charliehoey.com/">Charlie Hoey</a> this demo is a simulation of the charted stars in our Galaxy. You are able to explore the stars travelling both in space and time. Have you ever wondered how the stars are like lightyears away from Earth? Or how will they be thousands of years from now? This demo is your interstellar adventure.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blogpost we reviewed some 3D demos for Three.js News. They are all very diverse. We saw games, educational projects, simulations and funky characters. What they all have in common is their creativity and the use of 3D technology on the web. Some even go further and incorporate fun control sensor like the Leap Motion device. Have fun checking out all these demos. I hope you enjoy them as much as we did.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Three.js News and see you next time.</p>
