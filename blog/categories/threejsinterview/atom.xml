<p>Hello everybody! This is my first <em>Three.js Interview</em> video. The inspiration came from all those great people out there doing <a href="http://threejs.org">very cool projects with three.js</a>. I want to share their innovations with others. If you know me, you know that I love talking about three.js. So, I would like everybody to have the opportunity to enjoy and learn from these <a href="/blog/categories/threejsInterview/">three.js interviews</a>. So three.js interviews are videos of around one hour where people are talking about cool things they do with three.js . Maybe you could get some ideas for your own project or simply partake on a subject you're passionate about.</p>

<p>The idea is to have interesting people come and talk about cool things that they've done with three.js. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/BenAtExocortex">Ben Houston</a>, who is our guest in this first video. Ben is the Team Leader for <a href="http://clara.io/">Clara.io</a>, a online 3D modeling and rendering tool that you can use inside you browser. Ben talks to us about the creation and the evolution of <a href="http://clara.io/">Clara.io</a> and about all the interesting features it's got!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it and stay tuned for the next Three.js Interview :)</p>
