    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>It's been nearly a month since I started publishing <a href="/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">"One threex a day" challenge</a>. The idea was to share with you the many <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extensions</a> that I had written over time. I wanted to show you how they could be useful, fun and easy to include in your very own three.js game. I came up with a motto "One threex a day gets your game on its way". I was all set up and ready to go. This was a challenge inspired by John Resig's article called <a href="http://ejohn.org/blo!/write-code-every-day/">"Write code everyday"</a>. I deeply agree with his theory for making progress, increasing productivity and getting the work done. I wished to try something similar on myself.</p>

<p>Let me tell you though... it WAS challenging! Keeping the publication rhythm was hard. It takes a lot of discipline and organization to get it done everyday. I had the best intentions, but unfortunately I got sick and I felt bad for most of last week. Additionally I had some day work on the side that I needed to get done. At this rate of publication, it was very hard to keep up! At first I wanted to publish the threex extensions for a period of two months but I think it is best to rest for a while. So a week ago I published the last three.js game extension of phase 1.</p>

<p>The good news is that I've had a very interesting experience. I'm pleased with the results. Obviously, some posts got more attention than others. I think this was because the three.js game extensions I published weren't all for hard-core developers or game creators. Some were pretty basic, but still had educational value for people just starting with three.js. I wanted them to be directed to all kinds of audience, amateurs and experts alike. I really appreciated the process of sharing these extensions, and overall I had a great response. I got some <a href="https://plus.google.com/104300307601542851567/posts/RhabZY19TSq">very</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/104300307601542851567/posts/RqDbZNeJEkW">cool</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/siggraph/status/464238273582211072">retweets</a> and a lot of positive echo from you guys. Thanks a lot! Don't hesitate to contact me and give me some more feedback.</p>

<p>I stopped publication last week, but wait...I'm not saying I'm giving up though. Far from it. I have promised myself, and I promise my readers, to come back with more three.js extensions. Especially, because I still have a lot to publish, there are still some tricks up my sleeve ;)  For the moment I will concentrate on regaining my strength, writing more code and documenting it for the next threex batch. I hope to deliver and publish it soon.</p>

<p>Stay tuned! I'll be back.</p>

This is post is part of the <a href="/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">'one threex a day' challenge</a>.
This challenge is to publish every day one game extension for three.js!
One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.text">threex.text</a>.
threex.text is a <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex/">threex game extension for three.js</a> which makes it easy to add 3d text in your game. You can use it to create a big logo on top of a shop or a big sign of any kind Las Vegas style. Up to you to see :) It is very flexible. You can fine tune lots of parameters to make it fit your needs. You can choose the fonts, the size, the bevel, the weight etc...</p>

for details.</p>

<p>```
var mesh    = new THREEx.Text('THREEx', {</p>

<pre><code>font        : "droid serif",

As you can see you have different zones that make the terrain more varied, the blue zone represents water, the green one represents trees or grass and the white zone at the mountain top is snow. Imagine your video game character walking on these 3D mountains or flying over them, pretty cool eh? You can take him through river, forest, wind and snow if you want ;)</p>

<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<p>```html</p>

<script src='threex.terrain.js'></script>


<p>```</p>

<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<p><code>bash
bower install threex.terrain
</code></p>

<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<p>To allocate a heightMap with a width of 100 and a depth of 200, do</p>

<p><code>javascript
var heightMap   = THREEx.Terrain.allocateHeightMap(100, 200)
</code></p>

<p>To generate some heights based on a simplex/perlin noise, do</p>

<p><code>javascript
THREEx.Terrain.simplexHeightMap(heightMap)
</code></p>

<p>If you want to display it in three.js, built a <code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code> for it</p>

<p><code>javascript
// build the geometry
var geometry    = THREEx.Terrain.heightMapToPlaneGeometry(heightMap)
// init the material
var material    = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial();
// create the mesh and add it to the scene
var mesh    = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );
</code></p>

<p>To get the ground height of this mesh, use the following</p>

<p><code>javascript
var y = THREEx.Terrain.planeToHeightMapCoords(heightMap, mesh, x, z)
</code></p>

<p>It is possible to enhance the rendering of this heightmap with some vertexColor, and a
smoother shading if you want.</p>

<p>```
// build the geometry
var geometry    = THREEx.Terrain.heightMapToPlaneGeometry(heightMap)
// set the vertexColor in the geometry
THREEx.Terrain.heightMapToVertexColor(heightMap, geometry)
// init the material
var material    = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({</p>

<pre><code>shading     : THREE.SmoothShading,
vertexColors    : THREE.VertexColors,
</code></pre>

<p>});
// create the mesh and add it to the scene
var mesh    = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );
```</p>

<p>To get the height with heightMap coordinates, just use</p>

<p><code>javascript
var y   = THREEx.Terrain.heightMapToHeight(heightMap, x, z)
</code></p>

<p>If you want to display the result in a canvas 2d, just do</p>

<p><code>javascript
var canvas  = THREEx.Terrain.heightMapToCanvas(heightMap)
document.body.appendChild(canvas)
</code></p>

threex.poolball is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> which helps you build pool balls. It provides dynamically generated models of pool balls, so no model download needed. It may be fun to play with when you start with three.js, funnier than a plain sphere for sure :) You can use it for your bar games, having  your characters bet when playing pool, or even your <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/marbleTable/">Marble Table</a> games, as I did, adding cool granular sounds when the balls roll.</p>

threex.transparency is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> to easily handle transparency. Transparency is a tricky business in Webgl, but this extension makes it approachable. It is worth trying. Do you remember the transparency between the leaves of a tree in 3D games? Well, with this extension you will be able to add it to your own game. You can also make clouds appear transparent in the sky you have created for your game. It is easy to include and it gives a nice polish finish, a professional touch.</p>

<h2>How To Use It ?</h2>

<p>The algo is well described in this
<a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-10-transparency/">opengl tutorial about transparency</a>. We just adapt it to fit three.js.
First you setup all the objects that you want to be transparent</p>

<p><code>
THREEx.Transparency.init(objects)
</code></p>

<p>It will change the <code>THREE.Material</code> to make it support transparent.
Second you need to update all your objects at every frame.</p>

<p><code>
THREEx.Transparency.update(objects, camera)
</code></p>
